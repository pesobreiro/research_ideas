# Research Ideas

## Predicting time in swimmers
Testing  multivariate linear regression to predict swimming results

## Research Reproducibility
The developments that have been taking place in technologies and information systems allow greater capacities for data processing and analysis, facilitating the development of research. We propose an approach to support reproducibility (Peng, 2009), for Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) in Football Coaches Intervention and familiarize researchers with an improved workflow using R, R Markdown, and some libraries in the process of developing for scientific production.
