  title = {The creation of goal scoring opportunities at the 2015 womenâ€™s world cup},
  abstract = {Womenâ€™s international football is growing in terms of popularity, but to date there is limited published research in womenâ€™s football and even less that describes effective attacking strategies and the creation of goal scoring opportunities (GSO). The purpose of this research was to investigate and assess the factors related to the creation of GSO that led to a Top 4 position Canada Womenâ€™s World Cup 2015. Video footage of each match (n = 52) from the Womenâ€™s World Cup (Canada 2015) was analysed using SportsCode Software. The results revealed that the middle third of the pitch was the most effective area for gaining possession and creating GSO. The average time taken to create a GSO was under twelve seconds. The findings of the study can be used by coaches to design training sessions and interventions to successfully create GSO in womenâ€™s football. The data from the research may influence the tactical set up of womenâ€™s international football teams and help to evolve the game in the same way that research into the menâ€™s game has.

  title = {A Model of Discipline: The Rule(s) of Midnight Football and the Production of Order in Subjects and Society},
  abstract = {This article explores the rationalities of social change of a sports-based intervention, midnight football, carried out on two sites in the suburban landscape of Sweden. Based on interviews with coaches and managers and on-site observations, we examine how rationalities and technologies of social change are promoted, how technologies of social change are assumed to operate within the intervention, and how the intervention objectives are formed in relation to the technologies promoted. The analysis is guided by a Foucauldian perspective on disciplinary and pastoral power. It displays how various conceptualizations of risk underpin the intervention, and, in particular, technologies of spatial and temporal diversion. Youth are (dis)located to perceived sites of order and rule, as midnight football is portrayed as a regulated arena in opposition to outside sites of disorder. To form and visualize the rules of law, coaches, ascribed the position of role-models and law-makers, have a particularly important role to play, embodying law, rule, and conduct. In addition, disciplinary power operates through normalizing sanctions, stressing the corrective influence of coaches and readjustment of youth conduct. The technologies promoted are underpinned by goals to form a certain order of subjects, where ideals of conduct can be transferred and proliferated to the world outside, forming order and security in society. Those deemed at-risk and in need of social change, are addressed by means of discipline and control. Conclusively, the technologies promoted appear more as a symptom of existing patterns of inequalities and segregation than as a solution to the challenges confronted. Â© The Author(s) 2020.},

  title = {Prevalence and Treatment Outcomes of Hand and Wrist Injuries in Professional Athletes: A Systematic Review},
  abstract = {Background: Injuries to the hand and wrist constitute up to 25% of all athletic injuries, yet not much information is available on the effects of such injuries on the careers of professional athletes. Understanding whether elite athletes can return to sport and at what level has value for athletes, coaches, managers, and others, including athletes at other levels of play. Questions/Purposes: The purpose of this study was to systematically review the literature on injuries of the hand and wrist in professional athletes to determine the prevalence and types of injuries sustained in professional sports, the management and clinical outcomes of such injuries, and the statistics regarding return to play. Methods: A systematic review was conducted of PubMed/MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify all studies reporting on hand and wrist injuries in professional athletes that were published between January 1970 and April 2019. Inclusion criteria were injuries of the upper extremity distal to the elbow that occurred in professional athletes during athletic competition, English language, and a study cohort consisting of four or more subjects. Details of injury sustained, sport, treatment, clinical outcome, and return to sport were extracted. Results: We identified 32 nonoverlapping studies involving a total of 4299 hand and wrist injuries. The most common sport studied was baseball (eight studies), followed by football (seven), boxing (six), and basketball (five). Specific injury type was included in 29 of 32 studies and totaled 792 injuries. Metacarpal fractures were the most common injuries (n = 273; 34.5%), followed by thumb collateral ligament injuries (n = 110; 13.9%), phalangeal fractures (n = 87; 11.0%), and scaphoid fractures (n = 56; 7.1%). The overall operative rate was 18.3% (n = 708 of 3867). One-half of the studies reported the return to play (average, 2.8 months; range, 0.5 to 9 months). Seven studies reported sport-specific objective performance measures, with six describing consistent return to preinjury levels of performance among athletes. Conclusions: Based on the available evidence, a large majority of hand and wrist injuries in professional athletes are treated conservatively. Athletes frequently return to preinjury levels of performance after surgery. Additionally, return to play after a hand injury appears to be faster than that after other bony injuries. Further research is needed into the impact of these injuries on athletic performance, as well as how surgical intervention affects validated patient-reported outcome measures in professional athletes.

  title = {Overweight and obese men's experiences in a sport-based weight loss intervention for men},
  abstract = {In Western countries, such as Australia and the UK, a significantly greater proportion of men (relative to women) are overweight and obese, yet relatively few weight loss interventions have been developed that sufficiently target men. This lack of male-focused programming may be in part because â€˜traditionalâ€™ weight loss programs are unappealing for what is considered a â€˜hard-to-reachâ€™ population. One program that appears to have such appeal for men is the MAN v FAT Football (MVFF) program, based out of the United Kingdom, which is designed for men with a body mass index of (or greater than) 27.5. MVFF encourages men's participation in a community-based weight loss program that incentivizes weight loss through participation in a football league, and since 2016 MVFF has supported the weight loss efforts of several thousand men. Using MVFF as an exemplar, our aim was to derive insight into how men experience a male-only competitive, sport-based weight loss program. We recruited twenty-seven players (Mage = 41.13, SD = 9.93), and ten coaches (Mage = 31.8, SD = 11.55) from program locations throughout the United Kingdom. Using semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis, we identified several appraisal aspects of the program that players and coaches considered important, including the appeal of sport, competition on a level playing field, being part of a team, camaraderie, accountability, men sharing issues with other men, gender-sensitized environment, likeminded and similar men, and perceptions that traditional weight loss programs are tailored towards women. Player experiences (i.e., competence and enjoyment) and functional supports in the program (e.g., player handbook, weight loss coach) were reported to drive outcomes of effective weight loss and program retention. Interventions aiming to target men may be more successful working with rather than against formulations of identity such as masculinities, and this can be achieved by tailoring program content (e.g., messaging), settings (e.g., among men sharing similar characteristics such as body-type or goals), and mode of delivery (e.g., through organized sports, and leveraging competition to drive healthy behaviours).

  title = {A gender-sensitised weight-loss and healthy living program for men with overweight and obesity in Australian Football League settings (Aussie-FIT): A pilot randomised controlled trial},
  abstract = {Background Recent evidence shows that sport settings can act as a powerful draw to engage men in weight loss. The primary objective of this pilot study was to test the feasibility of delivering and to evaluate preliminary efficacy of Aussie-FIT, a weight-loss program for men with overweight/obesity delivered in Australian Football League (AFL) settings, in preparation for a future definitive trial. Methods and findings This 6-month pilot trial took place in Perth, Australia. Participants were overweight/obese (Body Mass Index [BMI] â‰¥ 28 kg/m2), middle-aged (35â€“65 years old) men. Participants were recruited in May 2018, and the intervention took place between June and December 2018. The intervention involved 12 weekly 90-min face-to-face sessions, incorporating physical activity, nutrition, and behaviour change information and practical activities delivered by coaches at 2 clubs. Data were collected at baseline and immediately postintervention. For trial feasibility purposes, 6-month follow-ups were completed. Outcomes were differences in weight loss (primary outcome) and recruitment and retention rates, self-reported measures (for example, psychological well-being), device-measured physical activity, waist size, and blood pressure at 3 months. Within 3 days of advertising at each club, 426 men registered interest; 306 (72%) were eligible. Men were selected on a first-come first-served basis (n = 130; M age = 45.8, SD = 8; M BMI = 34.48 kg/m2, SD = 4.87) and randomised by a blinded researcher. Trial retention was 86% and 63% at 3- and 6-month follow-ups (respectively). No adverse events were reported. At 3 months, mean difference in weight between groups, adjusted for baseline weight and group, was 3.3 kg (95% CI 1.9, 4.8) in favour of the intervention group (p &lt; 0.001). The intervention groupâ€™s moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was higher than the control group by 8.54 min/day (95% CI 1.37, 15.71, p = 0.02). MVPA among men attracted to Aussie-FIT was high at baseline (intervention arm 35.61 min/day, control arm 38.38 min/day), which may have limited the scope for improvement. Conclusions Aussie-FIT was feasible to deliver; participants increased physical activity, decreased weight, and reported improvements in other outcomes. Issues with retention were a limitation of this trial. In a future, fully powered randomised controlled trial (RCT), retention could be improved by conducting assessments outside of holiday seasons.

  abstract = {Despite the growing qualitative research examining the complexities underlying the delivery of video-feedback, no study has yet explored coachesâ€™ actual behaviours within this environment. Thus, this study aimed to explore junior coachesÂ´ behaviours and their underlying rationales during team-based video-feedback. Twenty-two in-season sessions delivered by four junior-elite coaches were filmed and analysed. Following previous studies and advised by a panel of experts, the tool employed was adapted from the Coach Analysis and Intervention System and the Arizona State University Observation Instrument, to represent the study context. Subsequently, semi-structured stimulated recall interviews were conducted to elucidate coachesÂ´ thinking, understanding, and rationalising of their behaviours. Data indicated a prescriptive approach to coaching within the video-feedback environment. Feedback was the most employed behaviour of all coaches, followed by silence, player participation, convergent, and divergent questioning. One coach had player participation as their second most utilised behaviour. Findings demonstrated varied levels of understanding for each coach and evidenced three different types of cognitive dissonance or epistemological gap between coachesÂ´ behaviours and understanding. Therefore, future coach development programmes, specific to video-based feedback, would need to consider each individual coach baseline behaviour and cognitions before intervening.

Athletes reported additional details on the injury or illness that was reported.Main Outcome Measures:The outcome measurements included when the injury or illness occurred, anatomical location, diagnosis, cause, perceived severity, treatment, estimated athlete exposure (AE) to training and competition, and time loss from sport. Measures were recorded from the teams' first competition through to the end the season and/or playoffs.Results:Twenty-nine of 30 varsity sports teams participated in this injury and illness surveillance protocol. The compliance of team ATs and varsity athletes was 89% (men: 94%, women: 82%). The overall injury and illness rates were 5.5 injuries and 1.7 illnesses per 1000 AEs, respectively. Men's injury rates were greater than women's, and injury rates of contact sports were greater than noncontact sports.Conclusions:The utilization of a prospective injury and illness surveillance protocol in the Canadian University sport system is feasible with good athlete, AT, and coach acceptance. The surveillance data should inform future injury and illness prevention strategies. Â© 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the impact of a novel coach development intervention (MASTER) on coaching practices of football coaches. The study involved six coaches (of 10â€“12 year old) from one representative football club (Australia Februaryâ€“July 2017). The 15-week multi-component intervention included a face-to-face workshop, ongoing mentoring, modelled training sessions, peer assessments and group discussions. MASTER is underpinned by positive coaching and game-based coaching practices and aimed to educate coaches on how to implement and operationalise a number of evidence-based coaching elements. At each of baseline and immediate post-intervention coaches were filmed three times and evaluated using a modified version of the Coach Analysis Intervention System. Using linear mixed model analysis, significant changes were observed for time spent performing playing-form activities [+15.4% (95% CI 6.01â€“24.79)(t(15) = 3.5, P = 0.003], with significant changes in the type of interventions undertaken and the nature of feedback given to athletes. Program feasibility was examined using measures of recruitment, retention, adherence and satisfaction. Results indicate program feasibility and high coach evaluation ratings. MASTER demonstrated effectiveness for improving coaching practices of football coaches during training sessions. Further large-scale trials will build evidence for the utility of MASTER for guiding coaching practices in football and other sporting codes.

Cardiac-autonomic responses to in-season training among Division-1 college football players. J Strength Cond Res 34(6): 1649-1656, 2020-Despite having to endure a rigorous in-season training schedule, research evaluating daily physiological recovery status markers among American football players is limited. The purpose of this study was to determine whether recovery of cardiac-autonomic activity to resting values occurs between consecutive-day, in-season training sessions among college football players. Subjects (n = 29) were divided into groups based on position: receivers and defensive backs (SKILL, n = 10); running backs, linebackers, and tight-ends (MID-SKILL, n = 11) and linemen (LINEMEN, n = 8). Resting heart rate (RHR) and the natural logarithm of the root mean square of successive differences multiplied by 20 (LnRMSSD) were acquired at rest in the seated position before Tuesday and Wednesday training sessions and repeated over 3 weeks during the first month of the competitive season. A position Ã— time interaction was observed for LnRMSSD (p = 0.04), but not for the RHR (p = 0.33). No differences in LnRMSSD between days was observed for SKILL (Tuesday = 82.8 Â± 9.3, Wednesday = 81.9 Â± 8.7, p > 0.05). Small reductions in LnRMSSD were observed for MID-SKILL (Tuesday = 79.2 Â± 9.4, Wednesday = 76.2 Â± 9.5, p â‰¤ 0.05) and LINEMEN (Tuesday = 79.4 Â± 10.5, Wednesday = 74.5 Â± 11.5, p â‰¤ 0.05). The individually averaged changes in LnRMSSD from Tuesday to Wednesday were related to PlayerLoad (r = 0.46, p = 0.02) and body mass (r = -0.39, p = 0.04). Cardiac-parasympathetic activity did not return to resting values for LINEMEN or MID-SKILL before the next training session. Larger reductions in LnRMSSD tended to occur in players with greater body mass despite having performed lower workloads, although some individual variability was observed. These findings may have implications for how coaches and support staff address training and recovery interventions for players demonstrating inadequate cardiovascular recovery between sessions.},

Football is particularly popular for men in this group. Several interventions have emerged over the past decade and there is a need to clearly articulate how they are intended to work, for whom and in what circumstances. Aims: To develop a theory-driven framework for a football intervention for men with severe, moderate and/or enduring mental health problems using a participatory realist approach. Methods: A participatory literature review on playing football as a means of promoting mental health recovery with a realist synthesis. It included the accounts and input of 12 mental health service users and the contributions of other stakeholders including football coaches and occupational therapists. Results: Fourteen papers were included in the review. Analysis revealed that interventional mechanisms were social connectedness, identity security, normalising experiences and positive affectivity. These supported mental health recovery. Outcomes were moderated by social stigma and several interventional factors such as over-competitiveness. Conclusions: The context mechanism outcome configuration framework for these interventions map well onto social models of mental health recovery and provide insight into how they work.

  abstract = {Heading the ball is an important skill in soccer. Head impacts are of concern because of the potential adverse health effects. Many elite players now wear GPS (that include inertial monitoring units) on the upper spine for location tracking and workload measurement. By measuring the maximum acceleration of the head and the upper spine, we calculated the acceleration ratio as an attenuation index for participants (n = 8) of different skill levels during a front heading activity. This would allow for in-field estimates of head impacts to be made and concussive events detected. For novice participants, the ratio was as high as 8.3 (mean value 5.0 Â± 1.8), whereas, for experienced players, the mean ratio was 3.2 Â± 1.5. Elite players stiffen the neck muscles to increase the ball velocity and so the torso acts as a support structure. Electromyography (EMG) signals that were recorded from the neck and shoulder before and after a training intervention showed a major increase in mean average muscle activity (146%, p = 3.39 Ã— 10âˆ’6). This was accompanied by a major decrease in acceleration ratio (34.41%, p = 0.008). The average head-ball impact velocity was 1.95 Â± 0.53 m/s determined while using optical motion capture. For this low velocity, the impact force was 102 Â± 19 N, 13% of the published concussive force. The voluntary action of neck muscles decreases isolated head movements during heading. Coaches and trainers may use this evidence in their development of junior players. Â© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

This systematic review examined the content and efficacy (changes in knowledge, impact on concussion incidence) of concussion education programs for coaches and parents of youth and high school athletes. Six databases were searched: SPORTDiscus, Academic Search Premiere, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Studies evaluated the use and/or efficacy of concussion education programs among coaches or parents of youth athletes. A total of 13 articles (out of 1553 articles) met selection criteria. Although different concussion education programs exist, only three have been evaluated in the literature: ACTive Athletic Concussion Training., USA Footballâ€™s Heads Up Football, and the Center for Disease Control and Preventionâ€™s HEADS UP. These programs are well liked among coaches and parents and the suggested practices are easily implemented by coaches. These programs increased concussion knowledge among coaches and parents and promoted behavioral changes among coaches to reduce the concussion risk in high school sports. Few studies have assessed the efficacy of concussion education programs on youth athlete health outcomes. No studies included a longitudinal follow up to determine the degree of knowledge retention following the intervention. While online educational programs are sufficient to improve coach knowledge, in-person training may be a more effective educational tool for reducing the incidence of youth sport concussion. Future studies addressing the efficacy of concussion education programs should include a longitudinal follow up to assess knowledge retention and fidelity. Â© 2020 by the authors.

  abstract = {While research on sport-related concussion has increased dramatically over the past decade, research investigating concussion reporting is in its early stages. The purpose of this project was to assess concussion reporting and work with stakeholders to develop and assess strategies to improve reporting. We used a multi-site, repeated measures design with three NCAA Division I football programs, including 223 athlete participants. A modified community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach was used to develop intervention strategies (Fall 2017 season) with stakeholders designed to increase concussion reporting intentions. Preseason and postseason surveys were administered to determine effectiveness. Main outcome measures included concussion knowledge, intervention effectiveness, and reporting intention measures. For all three programs, concussion knowledge was unrelated to reporting intentions. Two of the three programs implemented the intervention strategies and for these programs there was evidence that the interventions were effective. Specifically, athletes from these two programs perceived more support from coaches about reporting (P< 0.05; t= 2.83), received education more frequently (P< 0.05; t= 2.67), and reported being more likely to report concussion symptoms (P< 0.05; t= 2.14). Our study demonstrates that working with stakeholders to develop site-specific strategies to improve concussion reporting is an effective approach to help improve reporting behaviours.

  abstract = {The aim of this original research was to investigate the effect of a combination of feedback, action observation of a model, and motor imagery on passes accuracy in non-expert football players. All the participants performed a pre-test, 5 week-intervention sessions, and a post-test similar to the pre-test. The task consisted of passing toward a target located at 20-meters in an outdoor football field. During each session, the participants, divided into Control (i.e., physical practice only), Feedback, Model, Imagery, and Feedback plus Model plus Imagery (FMI) groups, performed 3 blocks of 4 trials. After each block, they received or not feedback by the coach, watched a clip or a video of a skilled peer model touching the target, and finally realized a mental task or motor imagery. The main results of this study revealed that the FMI group increased the performance from the pre-to the post-test, whereas the performance of all the other groups remained stable across the experimental conditions. The current study showed the beneficial effect of combining the observation of a model, the motor imagery, and expert feedback after physical practice, especially in the case of a short learning session in non-expert football players.

  title = {to mean something to someone": Sport-for-development as a lever for social inclusion},
  abstract = {Background: Socially excluded groups are at higher risk of low well-being and poor health. The link between social exclusion and health inequities is complex, and not being involved in society makes it difficult to be reached by standard prevention programs. Sport-for-development (SFD) programs are low-threshold and may be promising settings for inclusive actions. We explore the underlying mechanisms through which SFD might have an impact on social inclusion and examine the necessary conditions that work as a catalyst for these underlying mechanisms. Methods: A realist evaluation approach was adopted. A non-profit SFD organization in a middle-large city in Flanders, Belgium, formed the setting for a single case study. Document analysis, participatory observations, interviews, and a focus group, were sources for identifying necessary context elements and essential mechanisms through which SFD could promote its participants' health and wellbeing. Results: Among the most efficient mechanisms triggered by the Foundation's activities are learning by fun, connecting with peers (of whom some serve as role model) and engaging as a volunteer with some responsibilities. Building trust in oneself and in others is a necessary process throughout all these mechanisms. Facilitating context factors include the activities' accessibility and unconditional approach (creating a sense of safety), the popularity of the first division football team the Foundation is associated with (leading to a sense of belonging), a steady network of social partners and a strongly positive relationship with the SFD coach(es). Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that a SFD setting may be a vehicle for engaging hard-to-reach population groups. It enhances socially vulnerable persons' sense of competence and connectedness, leading to opportunities to improve life and work skills transferrable outside SFD settings. Based on these findings, suggestions are provided that may enhance the field and help to develop feasible (policy-led) interventions designed to promote social inclusion. Â© 2020 The Author(s).},

  title = {A Teaching Games for Understanding Program to Deal With Reasons for Dropout in Under-11 Football},
  abstract = {Young players report that they dropout of organized football due to excessive emphasis on technical execution, low success, and the lack of autonomy and motivation experienced by players during training sessions. Purpose: To determine whether a TGfU intervention during a youth football program led players to improve in variables related to dropout. That means tactical-technical competence (decision-making, skill execution), success (successful game performance), autonomy (number of decisions made, player autonomy, number of game involvements, player participation), and motivation (enjoyment, intention to be physically active). Method: Twenty under-11-players and two coaches were recruited from 17 clubs. A pretest-posttest design with a multi-method approach was used. Coaches were trained and mentored in TGfU. Data were collected using Game Performance Assessment Instrument, enjoyment and intention to be physically active scales, and two focus groups with the players and the coaches. Results: Players improved in decision-making, skill execution, successful game performance, number of decisions made, number of game involvements, and intention to be physically active (p <.05). Participants attributed the results to the TGfU pedagogical features emphasized during the coachesâ€™ training and mentoring. Conclusion: Considering the reasons for dropout in football, in terms of excessive emphasis on technical execution, low success, and the lack of autonomy and motivation experienced by players, TGfU could be a useful pedagogical approach for teaching-learning organized youth football. The TGfU pedagogical features emphasized during coachesâ€™ training and mentoring could be crucial to obtain these results due to the fact thatÂ they were the sub-themes highlighted during the focus groups.

  abstract = {Objectives: The purpose of the study was to assess the effect of a coaching intervention on soccer athletesâ€™ perceptions of the coachesâ€™ competencies, enjoyment, satisfaction, and intention to persist in the sport. Equipment and methods: The sample consisted of 117 young male soccer players and eight of their coaches who were divided into two groups: group receiving the coaching effectiveness intervention (EG) (n = 4; Mage = 32.50 years, SD = 14.24) with an average of 3.00 years of training experience (SD = 2.44); and control group (CG) (n = 4; Mage = 28.50 years, SD = 13.67) with an average of 6.25 years of training experience (SD = 2.87), and their 117 young male soccer players from 45 teams, aged between 10 and 16 years (Mage = 13.78, SD = 1.38). Focused on coach-effectiveness, coaches from EG received a 12-hour training program. Self-report questionnaires were administered to the athletes both at the beginning and the end of the intervention. A repeated-measures ANOVA was carried out for each dependent variable. Results: The results showed significant changes in coachesâ€™ game strategy competency, technique competency, and character-building competency as perceived by the players from the EG compared with the players from the CG. Also, both the CG and the EG athletes decreased their satisfaction with the coach. Thus, these types of interventions are effective for improving and maintaining over time variables related to athletesâ€™ perception of their coachesâ€™ competency, their own enjoyment, and intention to persist practicing sports.

Participants were randomly divided into Control, Feedback, Imagery, and Feedback+Imagery groups, within a pre- post- intervention design. The intervention lasted 7 weeks, and the task consisted of passing the ball to a target 20-meters away. In each intervention session, the participants performed 3 blocks of four physical trials. The participants of the Feedback and Feedback+Imagery groups received expert feedback, given by the coach, after each block and then, all the participants realized a mental task (countdown or motor imagery). Results showed that the Feedback+Imagery group had the greatest pre- to post-test improvement compared to the other groups, and highlight the beneficial effect of combining verbal feedback and motor imagery to improve soccer passing accuracy. It is suggested to coaches or physical education teachers to adapt their training by incorporating feedback and imagery. Â© 2020 Human Kinetics, Inc.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The â€œ11+ Kidsâ€  injury-prevention program has been shown to reduce injuries and related costs in youth football players less than 14 y of age. A major argument to convince coaches to use this exercise-based injury-prevention program is a potential performance enhancement of the players. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of the â€œ11+ Kidsâ€  program on isokinetic strength. Methods: Two teams were randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. The intervention group replaced their warm-up by the â€œ11+ Kidsâ€  and the control group warmed up as usual. Two days before and after the 10-wk intervention, isokinetic strength of the hip adductors and abductors, knee flexors and extensors, and ankle invertors and evertors was tested. Results: Thirty-one players (mean age 11.5 [0.8] y) completed the study. The intervention group showed large improvements in all isokinetic strength measures (P < .001 for all measures; Cohen d = 0.8â€“1.4), whereas the control group only showed negligible to medium positive effects (P values ranging from .006 to .718; Cohen d = âˆ’0.1 to 0.7). The intervention was beneficial compared with the control group regarding isokinetic strength of the hip adductors (P < .001), knee flexors (P = .002), and ankle evertors (P < .001) and invertors (P = .005). Conclusions: Given the relatively short intervention period of 10 wk, the observed improvements relate to a practically meaningful effect of the intervention. The gain in strength may improve playersâ€™ performance and may contribute to a reduction of injury risk in the long-term application. Â© 2020 Human Kinetics, Inc.},

  abstract = {This article draws attention to two sports-based interventions carried out as part of the Midnight Football initiative and the places where they are conducted in two suburban areas in Sweden. Rather than approaching geographic place as simply a background and a context for sport-based interventions, we put place in the spotlight, scrutinising the very formation of place and its productive role in governing social policy. In line with a Foucauldian approach, and based on interviews and ethnographic fieldwork, the aim of the article is to explore how the specific localities where interventions take place are formed as governable domains. The analysis shows how place is constituted in association with sport sites, local youth outreach and recruiting coaches. These places are made distinct from the rest of the surrounding cities via material and symbolic borders, directing the movement of people within the urban geography. These differentiations underpin attributions of the areas in terms of otherness and exclusion from the rest of society, localising a variety of problematisations to the demarcated areas. Furthermore, the places are demarcated as being filled with danger, intertwined with narratives challenging such a discourse. In conclusion, the findings enable us not only to scrutinise how specific meanings are attributed to place and how place is formed, but also to explore the performative and governable potential of place.

  abstract = {Purpose. The study aimed to compare the players' and coach's individual perception of tactical competence before and after an intervention based on imagery techniques and a multimedia resource (SpheroTM). Methods. SpheroTM, a teleguided miniature ball rolling in any direction, was applied to teach tactics before and during training sessions and games over a 5-week specific training program. The ball was used to represent a game ball, and cones were placed on a miniature soccer pitch to simulate the play and explain the coach's directives. The execution and the understanding of pre-game directives were respectively evaluated by the coach and the players themselves, before and after the training program. An empirical pre-post treatment was used to compare 245 rates provided by 14 players of an under-14 amateur soccer team in Canada. Descriptive analysis was performed and the t-test or Wilcoxon test (z) were used for paired comparison (pre- vs. post-training). The statistical significance of the results was set at p < 0.05. Results. After 5 weeks of training with the use of SpheroTM, results showed that the players appreciated their ability to play in accordance with directives, and that the coach was able to observe his directives through how they played, although the assessment scores of understanding remained the same. Conclusions. A teaching setup involving SpheroTM allowed a good understanding but training was necessary to reach better assessment scores for the actual application of the directives.

  abstract = {Context: The physical and mental demands of an elite football player are complex, which may explain why injuries are common in football. At elite level, muscle injuries of the lower-extremity are the most common among male football players, and the research hitherto is limited. Objective: To investigate whether personality traits affect the incidence of muscle injuries among male football players from the first league in Sweden. Design: Prospective cohort study. Participants: A male football team from the first league in Sweden was prospectively followed, in terms of muscle injuries of the lower-extremity during 8 seasons, between 2007 and 2015. Intervention: All muscle injuries included in this study were evaluated and diagnosed with ultrasonography. Players from the team filled out the Swedish Universities Scales of Personality questionnaire. Swedish Universities Scales of Personality questionnaire consists of 91 items and is divided into 13 categories. Main Outcome Measures: The raw values of each scale were linearly transformed to T scores, having a mean (SD) of 50 (10). All variables were summarized with standard descriptive statistics, such as frequency, mean, and SD. As data were of interval scale and no variable distribution was severely skewed, differences between noninjured players, rarely injured players, and frequently injured players were analyzed with 1-way analysis of variance with post hoc tests by Tukey honestly significant difference test. Results: No significant difference in personality traits were observed between noninjured players, rarely injured players, and frequently injured players regarding number of muscle injuries (P >.05). However, a trend (P =.07) was seen, where frequently injured players scored higher on stress susceptibility than rarely injured players. Conclusion: A player's stress susceptibility should be taken into consideration by the player, coaches, and medical staff when assessing the risk of a muscle injury. Also, preventive measures available for these players may need to be considered. Â© 2020 Human Kinetics, Inc.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was twofold: 1) to characterize a common microcycle considering both internal and external training loads; and 2) to identify the effects of small-sided games (SSGs) and of power and strength training on the fitness status of football players. METHODS: Fifteen male football players (age: 18.55Â±0.39 years) participated in this study. Ninety-two consecutive training sessions were monitored and analyzed over a period of nineteen weeks. Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was used as an internal load marker, and the distances covered at different speed thresholds and accelerations/decelerations were used as external load markers to characterize the common microcycle. Participants' body composition, vertical jumping ability, maximal strength, speed, and agility were assessed twice before and after the training monitoring process. RESULTS: The results revealed that match day -5 (MD-5) and MD-1 were associated with the lowest RPEscores (4.2 and 3.8 A.U., respectively). MD-4 and MD-3 were associated with the highest RPEvalues (9.2 and 8.8 A.U., respectively). Meaningful changes in RPEwere found between training days. External load monitoring revealed that MD-4 had the highest values of accelerations and decelerations &gt;2 m/s2/min (4.22 and 3.17, respectively) and MD-3 had the highest values of distance covered at high intensity (6.11 m/s2/min). Meaningful moderate improve-ments in jumping performance (d=0.90) and maximal strength parameters (d=0.83) were also found between assessments. CONCLUSIONS: It was identified that the concurrent approach had meaningful impacts on the fitness development of players and should be considered by coaches for future training interventions.

Hispanics have a 50% higher type 2 diabetes (T2DM) death rate compared to non-Hispanic whites, yet low participation in lifestyle change programs, making this subgroup an important target for prevention efforts. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of an exercise intervention implementing the Center for Disease Control and Prevention National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) plus recreational soccer (RS) in Hispanic men. Methods: Overweight and obese Hispanic men, aged 30â€“57 years with prediabetes at screening were recruited from the community. Trained soccer coaches led 30-min facilitated discussion of the NDPP modules after each RS session, with two weekly sessions delivered over 12 wks, then once a wk until 24 wks. The 1-h RS sessions followed the Football Fitness curriculum structure. Standardized study assessments included objectively measured physical activity via fitness tracker, physical fitness via validated field tests, global positional system soccer specific metrics and behavior change questionnaires. Mixed models assessed the outcomes as a function of time and cohort and incorporated an unstructured covariance structure to examine the difference between baseline, 12 and 24 wks. All analyses were conducted as intent-to-treat and generated using SAS v 9.4. RESULTS: Hispanic males (n = 41; mean age 41.9 [6.2 SD] years) were obese at baseline (mean BMI 32.7, standard error [0.7]). After 24 wks of the NDPP+RS intervention, there were significant beneficial changes in vertical jump (2.8 [1.3] cm; p = 0.048), agility and lower extremity muscular power (figure 8-run) at 12 wks (âˆ’4.7% change; p = 0.001) and 24 wks (âˆ’7.2% change; p &lt; 0.0001), predicted VO2 max (12 wks: 1.9%; p = 0.007; 24 wks 1.0%; p = 0.036), modified push-ups increased 22% (p &lt; 0.0001) at 12 wks and 31% (p &lt; 0.0001) at 24 wks, dynamic sit-ups increased 10% (p = 0.005) at 12 wks and 15% (p &lt; 0.0001) at 24 wks.

  title = {Data-informed Intervention Improves Football Technique and Reduces Head Impacts},
  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Although sport participation is a key contributor to the physical and mental health of children and youth, exposure to subconcussive head impacts in football has raised concerns about safety for athletes. PURPOSE: To demonstrate the efficacy of incorporating targeted football drills into a team's practice routine with the goal of improving players' technique and reduce exposure to subconcussive head impacts. METHODS: Seventy high school football players (age, 16.4 Â± 1.1 yr) were tested PRE season using a sport-specific functional assessment. Results from the testing were used to inform the design of a prepractice intervention aimed at improving tackling and blocking techniques while reducing exposure to head impacts. The assessment included drills which evaluated the players' ability to safely tackle, and block while simulating game-like situations. Testing was repeated at MID season (internal control) without an intervention, and again at POST season (experimental), after introduction of the prepractice intervention between these timepoints, administered twice weekly. All testing sessions were recorded, and subsequently reviewed by trained graders based on selected criteria defined by football coaches. A subset of 19 participants wore in-helmet accelerometers to assess the effectiveness of the intervention in decreasing head impacts during practice. RESULTS: Significant improvements in blocking and tackling techniques were observed after the introduction of the intervention (P < 0.0001). Participating athletes also showed better techniques when evaluated in new game-like situations, postseason, providing evidence for proper acquisition and generalizability of these safer habits. Finally, frequency of head impacts (>15g) per practice was significantly reduced by ~30% after 1 month of training. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that data-informed methods can be used to improve coaching practices and promote safer play, which can have a positive public health impact moving forward.},

To equip coaches with appropriate knowledge and skills, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched the HEADS UP: Concussion in Youth Sports online training. Objectives: To determine whether HEADS UP coachesâ€™ training improves knowledge, attitudes and behavioural intentions. Methods: Knowledge questions were grouped into scales by level of difficulty. Differences between pre- and post-test scores were calculated based on the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test Z-score and effect sizes were interpreted. Results: Coaches displayed a high level of knowledge in the pre-test. While lower difficulty questions did not show improvement from pre- to post-test, moderate and high difficulty questions did. Use of the training was associated with improved knowledge about symptom resolution, return-to-play recommendations and under-reporting of incidents of concussion. Coaches demonstrated improvement in five of the seven concussion-related attitude and behavioural intention items post training. Conclusion: HEADS UP training improved coachesâ€™ knowledge on select topics and helped them feel more comfortable about responding to concussion among their athletes. This study provides insight into how to better focus future HEADS UP concussion health education efforts to fit coachesâ€™ informational needs. Â© The Author(s) 2019.},

  abstract = {Background To assess the effects of the injury prevention programme '11+ Kids' on reducing severe injuries in 7 to 13 year old football (soccer) players. Methods Football clubs (under-9, under-11 and under-13 age groups) from the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland were cluster-randomised (clubs) into an intervention (INT) and a control group (CON). INT replaced their usual warm-up by '11+ Kids' two times a week. CON followed their regular training regime. Match and training exposure and injury characteristics were recorded and injury incidence rates (IRs) and 95% CIs calculated. For the present analysis, only severe injuries (absence from training/match â‰¥28 days) were considered. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using extended Cox models. Results The overall IR of severe injuries per 1000 football hours was 0.33 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.43) in CON and 0.15 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.23) in INT. There was a reduction of severe overall (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.72), match (0.41, 0.17 to 0.95) and training injuries (0.42, 0.21 to 0.86) in INT. The injury types that were prevented the most were: other bone injuries 66%, fractures 49% and sprains and ligament injuries 37%. Severe injuries located at the knee (82%), hip/groin (81%), the foot/toe (80%) and the ankle (65%) were reduced tremendously. Conclusions '11+ Kids' has a large preventive effect on severe injuries by investing only 15 to 20 min per training session. The present results should motivate coaches to implement effective injury prevention programmes such as the '11+ Kids' in children's football. Trial registration number NCT02222025.

  abstract = {The evolution of soccer over the past 30 years has brought about a faster pace of play and more demanding player dynamics that have led to a paradigm shift in how the game is analyzed. Classic, purely descriptive studies of midfielder performance paint a disjointed picture that is far from the reality of the complex network of relationships and interactions that mark modern-day soccer. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships established by Xavier â€œXaviâ€  HernÃ¡ndez, captain of FC Barcelona and a member of the Spanish national team for many years, during his participation in the final stages of the 2012 UEFA European Football Championship. The authors studied Xaviâ€™s relationship with other players on the pitch, the areas in which his interventions started and ended, his use of technicalâ€“tactical skills, and his involvement in set plays. A modified version of a purpose-designed observation instrument was used within an observational methodology study. The data were analyzed by polar coordinate analysis, which is a powerful data reduction technique that reveals significant prospective and retrospective relationships between a focal behavior (Xavi) and other behaviors of interest. The results show that Xavi presents a mutual activation with behaviors from J6 (Iniesta) and J21 (Silva) and significant relationships in attack set-up zones. He is also the most important player in set piece situations, when he uses technical behaviors of control and passing. Studies on tactical performance should analyze all inputs of play and focus on a deep, layered analysis of results to facilitate the work of soccer coaches and educators. Â© IMechE 2019.},

Various studies have investigated injury mechanisms, prevention programmes and immediate medical management of these injuries. However, relatively scant attention has been placed on the player's experience of such an injury and the importance of context. Aim The aim of this study was to explore the injury experience and its related context, as perceived by the catastrophically injured player. Methods A qualitative approach was followed to explore the immediate, postevent injury experience. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 48 (n=48) players who had sustained a rugby-related ASCI. Results Four themes were derived from the data. Participants described the context around the injury incident, which may be valuable to help understand the mechanism of injury and potentially minimise risk. Participants also described certain contributing factors to their injury, which included descriptions of foul play and aggression, unaccustomed playing positions, pressure to perform and unpreparedness. The physical experience included signs and symptoms of ASCI that is important to recognise by first aiders, fellow teammates, coaches and referees. Lastly, participants described the emotional experience which has implications for all ASCI first responders. Significance All rugby stakeholders, including players, first responders, coaches and referees, may gain valuable information from the experiences of players who have sustained these injuries. This information is also relevant for rugby safety initiatives in shaping education and awareness interventions. Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.},

  title = {Fat-free mass index in a diverse sample of Male collegiate athletes},
  abstract = {Fat-free mass index (FFMI) is a body composition metric that has been used to assess relative muscularity in athletes. Fat-free mass index is calculated by dividing FFM by height squared, although further height corrections through linear regression may be needed in taller individuals. This study reported height-adjusted FFMI (FFMIAdj) data in 209 male collegiate athletes from 10 sports (baseball, cross country, football, golf, ice hockey, weightlifting, rugby, swimming, track and field, and water polo) and the FFMIAdj natural upper limit for sports with sufficient sample size. The body composition of all subjects (mean 6 SD; age: 20.7 6 1.9 years, height: 182.9 6 6.7 cm, body mass: 90.8 6 16.8 kg, and percent body fat: 15.6 6 5.3) was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Linear regression was used to adjust for height, and the FFMIAdj natural upper limit was determined by calculating the 97.5th percentile of all values. One-way analyses of variance with Games-Howell post hoc comparisons were used to determine between-sport differences. A paired-samples t-test revealed a significant difference (p, 0.001) between unadjusted and adjusted mean FFMI values. The overall mean FFMIAdj was 22.8 6 2.8 kgÂ·m22. Significant between-sport differences (p, 0.001) in FFMIAdj were identified. Average FFMIAdj was highest in football athletes (24.28 6 2.39 kgÂ·m22) and lowest in water polo athletes (20.68 6 3.56 kgÂ·m22). The FFMIAdj upper limit was calculated for all athletes (28.32 kgÂ·m22), rugby (29.1 kgÂ·m22), and baseball (25.5 kgÂ·m22). This study reported FFMIAdj values in a diverse cohort of male collegiate athletes, providing data for the first time in several sports. These values can be used to guide nutritional and exercise interventions, predict athletic performance, and provide coaches with standardized information regarding the potential for further FFM accretion in male athletes.

  title = {Recruiting Older Men to Walking Football: A Pilot Feasibility Study},
  abstract = {Context: Walking football (soccer) has recently emerged as a physical activity option targeted at older males to enhance health and wellbeing. Design: This pilot study aimed to examine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining males aged 50 years and over to an 8-week walking football programme in a professional football club. Intervention: Participants were recruited via social media and assigned to an intervention group or a wait-list control group. The intervention group engaged in 1 h of walking football a week led by a community coach from the professional football club, followed by an optional social session in the club facility. Physiological and psychological outcome measures were obtained onsite at the football club facility (aiding compliance and retention) at baseline and following 8-weeks, from both groups. Semi-structured interviews were conducted after the 8-week programme and 1 year later, to explore motivations for engagement and the social impact. Results: The opportunity to engage in football and the link to a professional football club were key attractions. All participants recruited were overweight, sedentary, exhibited blood pressures outside normal ranges, and all but two were hypertensive. Adherence to the programme was 90% over 8 weeks, and of the participants who were contacted after one year, all (n = 6) had maintained engagement in walking football. Walking football is therefore a feasible, cost-effective method of recruiting and retaining males aged 50 years and over to a physical activity programme, though attrition is to be expected.

  title = {Injuries and concussions among young children, ages 5-11, playing sports in recreational leagues in Florida},
  abstract = {Background The specific research aims of this study included: 1) Conduct an epidemiologic analysis of recreational sports injuries among 1500 children, ages 5â€“11 in Florida: and 2) Utilize the computerized pediatric concussion tool from ImPACT Applications, Inc. for baseline and follow-up testing to better understand these injuries. This research followed a prospective surveillance design utilizing a large cohort of children, ages, 5â€“11, who play recreational football, soccer, and baseball/softball in Florida. The study venue was a large athletic facility in Hillsborough County, Florida. The sports observed were soccer (girlsâ€™ and boysâ€™), baseball, softball, and football. Internal and external advisory boards were consulted throughout the study. Methods Certified Athletic Trainers (ATCs) were hired to use High School Reporting Information Online (RIO) for injuries and the Ipad-administered pediatric concussion tool developed by ImPACT Applications, Inc for baseline/follow-up concussion data. Results Over the course of the project, 26 RIO-reported injuries were reported. Football and soccer produced the greatest rate of injuries. There were 12 concussions which comprised nearly half of all the RIO injuries (46%). We conducted 882 baseline concussion tests and 13 follow-up tests over the 2 years. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time data have been collected and reported on sports injuries in the study population. Future studies built on these findings will allow for the development of targeted guidelines and interventions for coaches, players, and parents so sports injury-related morbidity and mortality decrease in our youngest athletes.

  title = {A practitionerâ€™s perspective on psychological issues in football},
  abstract = {The challenges for professional football players are becoming more and more complex due to the multifaceted physical, technical, and psychological demands of the modern game. Psychological components have especially attracted the attention of science and are finding their way into practice. This overview article aims to discuss five psychological issues in football which the authors consider to be among the most relevant for sport-psychological practitioners. Each topic is structured identically: (a) topic description, (b) empirical evidence highlighting its relevance in football and potential impacts on performance, and (c) practical recommendations. The first two topics focus on the environment in football by discussing (1) organisational issues and (2) playerâ€“coachâ€“parent triads within football teams. Subsequently, the central theme performance is evaluated. (3) How do health and well-being impact long-term elite performance? (4) How can the training of psychological skills enhance performance? (5) How does â€œchoking under pressureâ€  affect performance? It can be stated that sport-psychological football research has provided several important and meaningful findings so far which can partly be adapted to practical settings. An even stronger focus of research in applied settings is warranted to gain further insights into the psychological underpinnings prevalent in the world of football. From a practical perspective, the article may provide both researchers and practitioners with valuable input on selected psychological topics in football. The summarised research can serve as a starting point for further research or interventions in practical settings. Â© 2018, Â© 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

  title = {Forecasting the development of explosive leg power in youth soccer players},
  abstract = {Purpose: Monitoring athletic development in youth soccer can help sporting professionals monitor athletic development and evaluate the effectiveness of training interventions. However, long-term follow up in talent development programmes in youth soccer is complicated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to forecast the developmental trajectories of explosive leg power in youth soccer players. Methods: Mixed effects regression models were used to forecast explosive leg power (countermovement (CMJ) and standing broad jump (SBJ)) in a longitudinal sample of 2201 youth soccer players from two high level BelgianÂ acedemies and the Belgian National teams. Players were aged between 6 and 20Â years (mean ageÂ =Â 13.04Â Â±Â 3.18Â y) and were subdivided into three age cohorts (6â€“10, 11â€“15, and 16â€“20Â y) for CMJ and two age cohorts (6â€“16, and 17â€“20Â y) for SBJ. Results: This study was able to accurately forecast explosive leg power using different regression equations in each age cohort. Conclusions: Researchers, coaches, and sporting professionals can use these methods to either predict future explosive leg power from current performance measures, monitor the development of explosive leg power, or assess the effectiveness of training interactions aimed at altering predicted developmental trajectories.

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of an intervention program, based on nonlinear pedagogy, on the decision-making and execution of different actions in futsal. The intervention program consisted of 12 training sessions. A quasi-experimental study was developed with eight male futsal players (M = 15.375, SD = 0.517). The GPET instrument was used to analyse the decision-making and execution of 3442 actions measured during competitive matches (pass, dribbling and shooting). Both variables were analysed with regard to the three tactical principles of attack: keep the ball possession, progression towards the goal and shooting at goal with the lowest level of opposition. With respect to the pass, results showed significantly higher values in decision-making and execution in the first and second principles, but not in the third one. In the dribbling action, results showed significantly higher values in decision-making in the second and third principle, but not in the first one. However, no significant differences were found in the shooting actions. These findings suggest that coaches should take into account in the task design, the tactical principles of play to develop tactical behaviour of youth futsal players. Â© The Author(s) 2018.},

  title = {The effect of a programme to improve menâ€™s sedentary time and physical activity: The european fans in training (EuroFIT) randomised controlled trial},
  abstract = {Background Reducing sitting time as well as increasing physical activity in inactive people is beneficial for their health. This paper investigates the effectiveness of the European Fans in Training (EuroFIT) programme to improve physical activity and sedentary time in male football fans, delivered through the professional football setting. Methods and findings A total of 1,113 men aged 30â€“65 with self-reported body mass index (BMI) â‰¥27 kg/m2 took part in a randomised controlled trial in 15 professional football clubs in England, the Netherlands, Norway, and Portugal. Recruitment was between September 19, 2015, and February 2, 2016. Participants consented to study procedures and provided usable activity monitor baseline data. They were randomised, stratified by club, to either the EuroFIT intervention or a 12-month waiting list comparison group. Follow-up measurement was post-programme and 12 months after baseline. EuroFIT is a 12-week, group-based programme delivered by coaches in football club stadia in 12 weekly 90-minute sessions. Weekly sessions aimed to improve physical activity, sedentary time, and diet and maintain changes long term. A pocket-worn device (SitFIT) allowed self-monitoring of sedentary time and daily steps, and a game-based app (MatchFIT) encouraged between-session social support. Primary outcome (objectively measured sedentary time and physical activity) measurements were obtained for 83% and 85% of intervention and comparison participants. Intention-to-treat analyses showed a baseline-adjusted mean difference in sedentary time at 12 months of âˆ’1.6 minutes/day (97.5% confidence interval [CI], âˆ’14.3â€“11.0; p = 0.77) and in step counts of 678 steps/day (97.5% CI, 309â€“1.048; p &lt; 0.001) in favor of the intervention. There were significant improvements in diet, weight, well-being, self-esteem, vitality, and biomarkers of cardiometabolic health in favor of the intervention group, but not in quality of life. There was a 0.95 probability of EuroFIT being cost-effective compared with the comparison group if society is willing to pay Â£1.50 per extra step/day, a maximum probability of 0.61 if society is willing to pay Â£1,800 per minute less sedentary time/day, and 0.13 probability if society is willing to pay Â£30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). It was not possible to blind participants to group allocation. Men attracted to the programme already had quite high levels of physical activity at baseline (8,372 steps/day), which may have limited room for improvement. Although participants came from across the socioeconomic spectrum, a majority were well educated and in paid work. There was an increase in recent injuries and in upper and lower joint pain scores post-programme. In addition, although the five-level EuroQoL questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) is now the preferred measure for cost-effectiveness analyses across Europe, baseline scores were high (0.93), suggesting a ceiling effect for QALYs. Conclusion Participation in EuroFIT led to improvements in physical activity, diet, body weight, and biomarkers of cardiometabolic health, but not in sedentary time at 12 months. Within-trial analysis suggests it is not cost-effective in the short term for QALYs due to a ceiling effect in quality of life. Nevertheless, decision-makers may consider the incremental cost for increase in steps worth the investment. Â© 2019 Wyke et al.},

  abstract = {Th is study aimed to explore the effects of previous instruction on technical, tactical and external workload performances in football small-sided games. Two 7-a-side balanced competitive teams received instructions regarding the rules of the small-sided games proposed. Additionally, one team received instructions from the coach regarding the collective tactical behaviour required for each exercise condition: (a) Without strategic instruction (WSI); (b) Defensive strategy (DS); (c) Offensive strategy (OS) to play against the team that only received the rules of the small-sided games. The comparisons among game scenarios were assessed via standardised mean differences. The comparison between WSI and DS revealed higher number of defensive actions, less space covered, and more distance covered in jogging for DS in comparison with WSI. The comparison between WSI and OS revealed more passes per ball possession, larger team length, larger space covered, lower distance covered walking, and more distance covered in jogging for OS in comparison with WSI. The results reinforce that coaches' previous instruction constrains the technical, tactical, and physical demands of small-sided games in football. The use of previous instruction regarding strategical and tactical behaviour allows highlighting the players' behaviour and ensures functional team performance. Â© 2018 by the author(s).},

  abstract = {In this article, we explore the pedagogies of (de)liberation promoted in the sports-based intervention Midnight Football (MF), carried out in a suburban and socio-economically disadvantaged residential area in Sweden. Based on interviews with coaches and managers and on-site observations, we examine how socio-pedagogical rationalities and technologies are articulated in discourse and assumed to operate within the intervention, and how certain ideals of conduct and social inclusion are represented in discourse. The analysis is guided by a Foucauldian perspective on a variety of forms of power. It displays how disciplinary forms of spatial and temporal diversion and dislocation of youth from sites of risk and danger to sites of order and football are formed within MF, where non-authoritative relations between coaches and youth can be facilitated, underpinned by a pastoral form of benign care and guidance. This, in turn, according to the rationality, enables pedagogies of sublime guidance and governing through deliberative and motivational dialogues, supporting youth to conduct themselves and, within the frames of football, choose the right track in life, away from gangs and crime. Making active and responsible choices means not only opportunities for individual deliberation, salvation and social inclusion, but moreover, security in and for the locality, community and society. The analysis illustrates how discipline, pastoral power and technologies of empowerment and of the self are intertwined and constitutive of the government promoted. Notably, dialogues between coaches and participants do not focus on the socio-economic inequalities or the socio-political context of segregation among the youth; instead, salvation becomes a question of the mindset of the youth, legitimizing a pre-given socio-economic and socio-political order of social exclusion. Still, there is unfulfilled potential for critical pedagogy and (de)liberative dialogues for articulating the conditions for participation in sport and in society on the terms of the participating youth.

The program was based on the promotion of motivational and methodological strategies with the purpose of optimizing the athletes' basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence and relatedness, through an interpersonal style of support and, in turn, reducing the controlling behaviors. Participated eight coaches intentionally distributed in two groups: experimental group (n = 4) and control group (n = 4). After observing of the interpersonal style of the coaches (pre and post) by an instrument created on purpose for the study, there was not significant differences in the extent post-intervention between groups, regarding the repeated measures analysis of the experimental group there are improvements between pre-intervention and post-intervention measure. Therefore, the program is effective but not to the extent expected, so it is necessary to continue research in this line of work. Â© 2018: Servicio de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Murcia.},

  abstract = {Objective:The ACTN3 R577X gene variant results in the absence of the Î±-actinin-3 protein in âˆ¼18% of humans worldwide and has been associated with athletic performance and increased susceptibility to eccentric muscle damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between ACTN3 R577X variant and indirect muscle disorders/injuries in professional football players.Design:A case-control, genotype-phenotype association study.Intervention:Two hundred fifty-seven male professional Italian football players (from Serie A, Primavera, Allievi, and Giovanissimi; age=21.2 Â± 5.3 years) and 265 nonathletic controls were recruited for the study. Genomic DNA was extracted using a buccal swab, and the ACTN3 R577X genotype was performed using a PCR method. Structural-mechanical injuries and functional muscle disorders were collected from a subgroup of 169 football players during the period of 2009 to 2014.Main Outcome Measure:We hypothesized that the 577XX genotype would be associated with higher predisposition to muscle injuries (compared with the other genotypes).Results:ACTN3 XX (Î±-actinin-3 deficiency) players had 2.66 higher odds for an injury incidence than their ACTN3 RR counterparts (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-6.63, P=0.02), whereas RX and RR players had similar injury incidence. Furthermore, ACTN3 XX players had 2.13 higher odds for having a severe injury compared with their RR counterparts (95% CI: 1.25-3.74, P=0.0054), whereas RX individuals had 1.63 higher odds for having a severe injury compared with the RR players (95% CI: 1.10-2.40, P=0.015).Conclusions:The ACTN3 R577X polymorphism is associated with the incidence and severity of muscle injuries in professional football players; players with the ACTN3 577XX genotype have higher odds of having muscle injuries than their RR counterparts.Clinical Relevance:Discovering the complex relationship between gene variants and muscle injuries may assist coaches, physiologists, and the medical community to development tailored injury prevention program for football players, which could provide a new edge for successful competition.

J Strength Cond Res 33(10): 2635-2640, 2019-The aim of this study was to determine the within-session reliability in kinetic variables of the squat in well-trained athletes during a typical resistance training protocol. Fifteen subjects completed 2 testing sessions. Session 1 was establishment of 1 repetition maximum (1RM) squat, and session 2 involved 2 sets of 2 maximal effort repetitions of the squat at 70, 80, and 90% of 1RM with 3D motion analysis and ground reaction force (GRF) measurement using 2 in-ground triaxial force plates. Reliability was calculated using typical error 6 90% confidence limits, expressed as the coefficient of variation and intraclass correlation coefficient. The smallest worthwhile change (SWC%), calculated as 0.2 3 between-subject SD, was used to determine the smallest important change in performance. Peak GRF and average GRF were found to have acceptable measures of reliability with the combined left and right leg average GRF capable of detecting the SWC. Independent limb contributions were reliable (left and right, or dominant and nondominant). Reliable kinetics can be obtained in back squat performance typical of a resistance training session in well-trained athletes. This suggests that coaches integrating force plate technology within training sessions may effectively capture between 1 and 6 training sets among several athletes, facilitating analysis and intervention on larger data sets.

  title = {Development of an Educational Program for Non-Professional Soccer Coaches in Charge of Community-Based Soccer in Men with Prostate Cancer: a Qualitative Study},
  abstract = {Background: While clinical trials have demonstrated the benefits of structured exercise for prostate cancer survivors, few attempts have been made to investigate and implement sustainable community-based exercise programs supporting adoption of long-term physical activity behavior. Against this background, the aims of this study was to explore the perspectives of experts and stakeholders on the development of a training course and intervention manual used to support the delivery of community-based soccer training in men with prostate cancer (the FC Prostate Community [FCPC] trial). Methods: A two-step qualitative design including triangulation of methods, data sources, and researchers. Step 1 comprised key informant interviews with clinical and scientific experts (n = 4). Step 2 included stakeholder focus group interviews with nurses (n = 5), non-professional soccer coaches and club representatives (n = 5), and prostate cancer survivors (n = 7). Results: Four themes emerged from the analysis of the key informant interviews: The Coachâ€™s Qualifications, Structure of the Training, Prevention of Injuries, and A Non-Patient Environment, which informed development of the training course and intervention manual. The stakeholders added the importance of clarifying the Responsibility of the Coach, the value of Positive Competition, and Social Inclusion of the prostate cancer survivors in the club. Based on these results, we present the final templates for the training course and intervention manual. Conclusions: No general set of rules or safety measures to promote or optimize the delivery of community-based exercise in cancer survivors is recommended. However, the general principles related to the necessary clarification of the coachâ€™s responsibility in relation to the prevention and management of injuries and participant adherence through a non-patient environment may be transferable to the training and education of other groups of lay persons in charge of delivering exercise interventions to other clinical subpopulations in a non-hospital setting.

Motor performance tests were conducted 1Â week prior and 1Â week after the competition season. We used magnitude-based inferences and linear mixed-effects models to analyse performance test results. INT showed superior results compared to CON in the vertical jump height 7.5% (95%-CI 4.4%, 10.7%), the Bosco 15-s-jump test 7.2% (95%-CI 2.2%, 12.4%), and the Illinois agility test âˆ’2.6% (95%-CI âˆ’4.1%, âˆ’1.1%). Possibly beneficial effects in favour of INT were found in the 9.1Â m sprint test âˆ’3.1% (95%-CI âˆ’6.1%, 0.1%). Possibly harmful effects (i.e. in favour of CON) were observed in the dribbling test 2.8% (95%-CI âˆ’0.8%, 6.4%). The 11+ warm-up programme can improve different performance measures in football players. Coaches might implement additional dribbling drills next to the 11+ to achieve improvements observed in dribbling ability when using a regular warm-up programme.

  abstract = {Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of formative feedback for the coach on the agreement between intended, observed and perceived exertion in soccer. Methods: A quasi-experimental study design was conducted using a feedback intervention. Agreement between coach and players was assessed with and without feedback. The coach filled in the Rating of Intended Exertion (RIE) before training and the Rating of Observed Exertion (ROE) after the training for all individual players. Twelve U23 (age 20.3Â Â±Â 1.5; height 180.5Â Â±Â 4.8Â cm; weight 74.8Â Â±Â 6.6Â kg) soccer players registered Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE). Furthermore, training duration (minutes), total distance (km), average speed (kmÂ·hâˆ’1), number of sprints, distance &gt;14.4Â kmÂ·hâˆ’1 (km), TRIMP and time &gt;85% maximal heart rate (min) were collected. Results: About 231 RPEs were collected and paired with RIE and ROE of the coach. The average discrepancy between ROE and RPE, decreased from 1.0Â Â±Â 0.89 without feedback to 0.7Â Â±Â 0.73 with feedback (pÂ &lt;Â 0.003, ES 0.4). Further analyses revealed that this reduction in mismatch was particularly present in hard training sessions (pÂ &lt;Â 0.004, ES 0.6), but not for easy and intermediate sessions. The mismatch between RIE and RPE did not improve. Conclusions: The results indicate that feedback improves the ability of a soccer coach to observe individual player exertion for most players, with small to moderate effect sizes. The mismatch between intended and perceived exertion did not improve with feedback. The use of formative feedback about load to coaches is recommended, particularly after hard sessions.

  title = {Protocol for a gender-sensitised weight loss and healthy living programme for overweight and obese men delivered in Australian football league settings (Aussie-FIT): A feasibility and pilot randomised controlled trial},
  abstract = {Introduction Overweight and obesity are highly prevalent among Australian men. Professional sports settings can act as a powerful 'hook' to engage men in weight loss programmes; the Football Fans in Training programme delivered in professional UK soccer clubs was successful and cost-effective in helping men lose weight. The Australian Football League (AFL) is a potentially attractive setting to engage men in a weight loss programme. We aim to develop, pilot and evaluate the feasibility of a weight loss intervention for overweight/obese middle-aged men, delivered in AFL settings, to promote weight loss and healthier lifestyles and determine its suitability for a future randomised control trial. Methods and analysis 120 overweight/obese male fans will complete baseline physical and psychological health measures and objective measures of physical activity (PA), weight, waist size and blood pressure prior to randomisation into the intervention or waitlist comparison group. The intervention group will receive 12 weekly 90 min workshops incorporating PA, nutrition education, behaviour change techniques and principles of effective motivation. Four community coaches will be trained to deliver Aussie-FIT at two AFL clubs in Western Australia. Measurements will be repeated in both groups at 3 months (post-intervention) and 6 months (follow-up). Outcomes will include programme uptake, attendance, changes in lifestyle and weight variables to inform power calculations for a future definitive trial, fidelity of programme delivery, acceptability, satisfaction with the programme and perceptions of effectiveness. We will also determine trial feasibility and potential to gather cost-effectiveness data. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval was granted by Curtin University's Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC2017-0458). Results will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations and reports. A multicomponent dissemination strategy will include targeted translation and stakeholder engagement events to establish strategies for sustainability and policy change.

  title = {The efficacy of an iterative â€œsequence of preventionâ€  approach to injury prevention by a multidisciplinary team in professional rugby union},
  abstract = {Objectives: Due to the complex systems nature of injuries, the responsibility for injury risk management cannot lie solely within a single domain of professional practice. Interdisciplinary collaboration between technical/tactical coaches, strength and conditioning coaches, team doctors, physical therapists and sport scientists is likely to have a meaningful impact on injury risk. This study describes the application and efficacy of a multidisciplinary approach to reducing team injury risk in professional rugby union. Design: Observational longitudinal cohort study. Methods: Epidemiological injury data was collected from a professional rugby union team for 5 consecutive seasons. Following each season, these data informed multidisciplinary intervention strategies to reduce injury risk. The effectiveness of these strategies was iteratively assessed to inform future interventions. Specific examples of intervention strategies are provided. Results: Overall team injury burden displayed a likely beneficial decrease (âˆ’8%; injury rate ratio (IRR) 0.9, 95%CI 0.9â€“1.0) from 2012 to 2016. This was achieved through a most likely beneficial improvement in non-contact injury burden (âˆ’39%; IRR 0.6, 95%CI 0.6â€“0.7). Contact injury burden was increased, but to a lesser extent (+18%; IRR 1.2, 95%CI 1.1â€“1.3, most likely harmful) during the same period. Conclusions: The range of skills required to effectively manage complex injury phenomena in professional collision sport crosses disciplinary boundaries. The evidence presented here points to the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary approach to reducing injury risk. This model will likely be applicable across a range of team and individual sports.

  title = {Coach-directed education is associated with injury-prevention behaviour in players: An ecological cross-sectional study},
  abstract = {Background/aim: Rugby union ('rugby') presents an above-average risk of injury to participants. BokSmart is a South African nationwide intervention that aims to reduce rugby-related injuries in players. This is achieved by educating coaches and referees to improve injury behaviour of players. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess if the receipt of injury-prevention education was associated with player behaviour. Methods: Junior (n=2279) and senior (n=1642) players, who attended merit-based South African Rugby tournaments (2008-2012), completed an anonymous questionnaire. Logistic regressions investigated if player injury-prevention behaviours were associated with the receipt of education on the same topic. Additionally, players' preferred sources of education were explored through frequency and Ï‡2 analyses. Results: Of the 16 injury-prevention behaviours, 12 (75%) were associated with receiving education on that topic. The four behaviours not associated with education were: warming-up (before training and matches), and avoiding heat and massage post injury. Of the seven possible sources of this education, the majority of players chose either coaches or physiotherapists as their preferred media. In comparison with junior players, more senior players chose physiotherapists instead of coaches for warming-up and cooling-down education. Conclusions: The results of this study support, to a large degree, the strategy of BokSmart - influence of player behaviour through coach education. However, these findings also suggest that BokSmart could target team physiotherapists in addition to coaches and referees with their safety education. Also, players might have different preferences for this education depending on their age. Â© 2018 Article author(s). All rights reserved.},

  title = {Characteristics of Operative Shoulder Injuries in the National Collegiate Athletic Association, 2009-2010 Through 2013-2014},
  abstract = {Background: Injuries to the upper extremity among collegiate athletes are reported to account for approximately 20% of all injuries; however, little is known about the proportion of these injuries that require surgery. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to examine all shoulder injuries that required a surgical intervention and were recorded in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Injury Surveillance Program (ISP). We hypothesized that contact would be the mechanism causing injuries most at risk for needing surgery and that dislocations would be the injuries most likely to require an operative intervention. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Injury surveillance data between 2009-2010 and 2013-2014 for operative collegiate shoulder injuries and their associated sport exposures were analyzed. Results: A total of 185 operative shoulder injuries occurred over 3,739,004 athlete-exposures (AEs), for an overall incidence of 0.49 per 10,000 AEs. The sports with the highest incidence of operative injuries were menâ€™s football (1.31/10,000 AEs), menâ€™s wrestling (1.14/10,000 AEs), menâ€™s ice hockey (0.60/10,000 AEs), womenâ€™s gymnastics (0.44/10,000 AEs), and menâ€™s swimming (0.41/10,000 AEs). Men were significantly more likely than women to sustain operative injuries for all sports combined. Of the injuries that required surgical treatment, superior labrum from anterior to posterior (SLAP) tears (46.4%), other non-SLAP glenoid labrum tears (46.2%), anterior shoulder dislocations (33.3%), and posterior shoulder dislocations (30.0%) were seen most often. There was no significant difference in injury proportion ratios (IPRs) for injuries requiring surgery when comparing contact versus noncontact mechanisms of injury (IPR, 1.0 [95% CI, 0.6-1.6]). The incidence of operative injuries sustained during competition was significantly higher compared with during practice. Conclusion: The sports with the highest incidence of operative shoulder injuries were menâ€™s football, menâ€™s wrestling, menâ€™s ice hockey, and womenâ€™s gymnastics. Operative shoulder injuries were more likely to occur during competition. SLAP tears, other non-SLAP glenoid labrum tears, and anterior shoulder dislocations had the highest incidence of requiring surgery. Athletes sustaining these injuries, along with their coaches and medical providers, may benefit from identifying collegiate sport participants who are at highest risk for sustaining an operative injury. This may assist in planning medical care and setting expectations, which may be critical to a young athleteâ€™s career. Â© The Author(s) 2018.},

  abstract = {Background: Sports-related concussion (SRC) injury rates, and identifying those athletes at the highest risk, have been a primary research focus. However, no studies have evaluated at which time point during an athletic event athletes are most susceptible to SRCs. Purpose: To determine the clinical incidence of SRCs during the start, middle, and end of practice and competition among high school male and female athletes in the state of Michigan. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiological study. Methods: There were 110,774 male and 71,945 female student-athletes in grades 9 through 12 (mean time in high school, 2.32 Â± 1.1 years) who participated in sponsored athletic activities (13 sports) during the 2015-2016 academic year. An SRC was diagnosed and managed by a medical professional (ie, MD, DO, PA, NP). SRC injuries were reported by certified athletic trainers, athletic administrators, and coaches using the Michigan High School Athletic Association Head Injury Reporting System. Time of SRC was defined as the beginning, middle, or end of practice/competition. Clinical incidence was calculated by dividing the number of SRCs in a time point (eg, beginning) by the total number of participants in a sport per 100 student-athletes (95% CI). Risk ratios were calculated by dividing one time point by another time point. Results: There were 4314 SRCs reported, with the highest in football, womenâ€™s basketball, and womenâ€™s soccer. The total clinical incidence for all sports was 2.36 (95% CI, 2.29-2.43) per 100 student-athletes. The most common time for SRCs was the middle, followed by the end of all events. Athletes had a 4.90 (95% CI, 4.44-5.41) and 1.50 (95% CI, 1.40-1.60) times greater risk during the middle of all events when compared with the beginning and end, respectively. There was a 3.28 (95% CI, 2.96-3.63) times greater risk at the end of all events when compared with the beginning. Conclusion: Athletes were at the greatest risk for SRCs at the middle of practice and competition when compared with the beginning and end. Clinical Relevance: The current study suggests that medical attention is particularly important during the middle of all athletic events. Intervention measures to limit SRCs may be most beneficial during the middle of athletic events. Â© 2018 The Author(s).},

  title = {A comparison of game-play characteristics between elite youth and senior Australian National Rugby League competitions},
  abstract = {Objectives: To compare game-play characteristics between elite youth and senior Australian National Rugby League (NRL) competitions. Design: Longitudinal observational. Methods: The dataset consisted of 12 team performance indicators (e.g., â€˜all runsâ€™ â€˜offloadsâ€™ and â€˜tacklesâ€™) extracted from all 2016 national under 20 (U20) competition (elite youth; n = 372 observations) and National Rugby League (NRL) (elite senior; n = 378 observations) matches. Data was classified according to competition (Two levels: U20 and NRL) and modelled using two techniques. Firstly, non-metric multidimensional scaling resolved multivariate competition (dis)similarity, visualised using a two-dimensional ordination. Secondly, a conditional interference (CI) classification tree was grown to reveal the performance indicators most capable of explaining competition level. Results: Non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed high competition dissimilarity, with U20 and NRL teams orienting distinctive positions on the first dimension of the ordination surface. Five team performance indicators were retained within the CI tree (â€˜all runsâ€™ â€˜tackle breaksâ€™ â€˜tacklesâ€™ â€˜missed tacklesâ€™ and â€˜kicksâ€™), which correctly classified 79% of the U20 observations and 93% of the NRL observations. Conclusions: Multivariate differences between elite youth and senior rugby league competitions were identified. Specifically, NRL game-play was classified by a greater number of â€˜all runsâ€™ and â€˜tacklesâ€™ and a lower number of â€˜missed tacklesâ€™ relative to the U20 competition. Given the national U20 competition is purported to assist with the development of prospective NRL players, junior coaches may consider training interventions that primarily aid the tackling capacities of players. This may subsequently assist with talent development and player progression in Australian rugby league. Â© 2017},

  abstract = {This study evaluated the impact of a brief (20-min) nutrition education intervention embedded in an existing mandatory coach education course for coaches of junior (8-12 years old) Australian football teams. A total of 284 coaches (68% of 415 coaching course participants) completed a presession questionnaire, and 110 coaches (27% of coaching course participants) completed an identical postsession questionnaire. The responses to the pre- and postsession surveys were matched for 78 coaches. Coaches' ratings of their own understanding of the nutritional needs of young athletes (6.81, 8.95; p < .001), the importance of young athletes adhering to a healthy diet (9.09, 9.67; p = .001), their confidence in their own nutrition knowledge (7.24, 8.64; p < .001), and their confidence in advising young athletes on nutrition and hydration practices (6.85, 8.62; p < .001), all significantly improved following the education session. Nearly all coaches (>95%) provided a correct response to six of the 15 nutrition and hydration knowledge questions included in the presession questionnaire. Even with this high level of presession knowledge, there was a significant improvement in the coaches' nutrition and hydration knowledge after the education session across five of the 15 items, compared with before the education session. The results of this study suggest that a simple, short nutrition education intervention, embedded in an existing coach education course, can positively influence the nutrition knowledge and self-efficacy of community-level, volunteer coaches of junior sports participants.

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of two different exercise interventions in the morning on football-specific components of performance in the afternoon under conditions simulating a competition day. In the morning on 3 experimental days, 12 football players (age 24.1â€¯Â±â€‰5.5 years) completed three different preload interventions that were applied in a counter-balanced order: (1) no intervention (NI); (2) moderate-intensive exercise (MI); and (3) high-intensive exercise (HI). The subjects performed the preload exercises, consisting of a small-sided game and repeated maximal sprints, from 10:00-11:00 a.m. At 3:00 p.m., the Bangsbo test (BT) was applied to examine the effects of the different morning interventions on football-specific endurance capacity. The results showed that the HI led to significantly higher blood-lactate concentrations (moderate to very large effect) and heart rates (very large to extremely large effect) compared to the MI. In addition, there was a significant measurementâ€¯Ã—â€‰intervention effect on concentrations of adrenalin and noradrenalin in the urine, which reached higher values immediately after the HI (very large effect) and MI (moderate effect) compared to NI. All effects disappeared by the time of the BT in the afternoon. During all trials, after the preload intervention, reaction time and critical flicker fusion frequency increased significantly compared to the baseline morning values (reaction time: small; critical flicker fusion: trivial to small effect), but no measurementâ€¯Ã—â€‰intervention interaction was found. During the BT, the mean total distance covered (trivial to small effect) and the pacing pattern did not differ significantly among the trials despite numerous small individual effects. We conclude that exercise interventions of various intensities in the morning have no general effect on football-specific components of performance in the afternoon despite significant metabolic, endocrinological and cognitive short-term effects. Coaches should consider individual preferences when prescribing competition-day procedures. Â© Springer-Verlag GmbH Deutschland, ein Teil von Springer Nature 2018.},

Materials and methods: An online survey relating to the perceptions surrounding injury data collection, its value and use was developed. Forty-seven applied practitioners working for different professional football academies completed the survey. Results: Injury data collection procedures conducted by appropriately trained medical staff are widespread among football academies. Injury data collection within academies was deemed worthwhile and important by 79% of practitioners. Similarly, 79% strongly agreed/agreed that using injury data for academic research is worthwhile. The engagement with and use of injury data by coaching staff appears to be relatively poor, with only 49% of practitioners stating coaches formally review data. Conclusions: Injury data are widely collected within academies and practitioners consider this information valuable. However, improving engagement with coaches and using the data for academic research could further improve applied practice. Practical implications: Applied practitioners should consider sharing injury data with both researchers and coaches. In doing so evidence-guided injury prevention interventions may be developed and subsequently applied in the field. Â© 2017, Â© 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

  abstract = {Objective: To assess how different decision-guiding factors, such as health- and performance-related stakeholders, as well as evidence-based guidelines, support the process-oriented final positive return-to-play (RTP) decision of head coaches responsible for semiprofessional sport teams. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Team sport. Participants: A survey consisting of questions on the importance of different decision-guiding factors used when making the RTP decision after injuries was administered to and completed by head coaches (N=238) of semiprofessional players' teams. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: With respect to helpfulness in the RTP decision-making process, the coaches rated both the importance of the opinions of physicians, physiotherapists, strength and conditioning coaches, and the athletes themselves, and the importance of the general and injury-specific RTP guidelines. Results: Our survey revealed that the head coaches rely on physicians and physiotherapists to a large extent, to the athletes and to themselves to a medium extent, and to strength and conditioning coaches and RTP guidelines to a small but still relevant extent. The coaches' efforts to seek a shared decision-making process in RTP are, hence, partially evident. Conclusions: A multitude of actuators intervene when making the RTP decision. The professionalization of the RTP process in semiprofessional sports includes the athletes themselves, the head coaches, the (external) physicians, the (external) physiotherapists, and the strength and conditioning coaches based on general RTP decision-making models and specific criteria related to injury type, sports type, level, and playing position. The development of awareness and implementation strategies of RTP models should be subject to further research. Â© 2017 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine},

  title = {Working towards more effective implementation, dissemination and scale-up of lower-limb injury-prevention programs: Insights from community australian football coaches},
  abstract = {Disseminating lower-limb injury-prevention exercise programs (LL-IPEPs) with strategies that effectively reach coaches across sporting environments is a way of preventing lower-limb injuries (LLIs) and ensuring safe and sustainable sport participation. The aim of this study was to explore community-Australian Football (community-AF) coachesâ€™ perspectives on the strategies they believed would enhance the dissemination and scale-up of LL-IPEPs. Using a qualitative multiple case study design, semi-structured interviews with community-AF coaches in Victoria, Australia, were conducted. Overall, coaches believed a range of strategies were important including: coach education, policy drivers, overcoming potential problem areas, a â€˜try before you buy approachâ€™, presenting empirical evidence and guidelines for injury-prevention exercise programs (IPEPs), forming strategic collaboration and working in partnership, communication and social marketing, public meetings, development of a coach hotline, and targeted multi-focused approaches. A shift to a culture whereby evidence-based IPEP practices in community-AF will take time, and persistent commitment by all involved in the sport is important. This will support the creation of strategies that will enhance the dissemination and scale-up of LL-IPEPs across community sport environments. The focus of research needs to continue to identify effective, holistic and multi-level interventions to support coaches in preventing LLIs. This could lead to the determination of successful strategies such as behavioural regulation strategies and emotional coping resources to implement LL-IPEPs into didactic curricula and practice. Producing changes in practice will require attention to which strategies are a priority and the most effective. Â© 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  title = {Coach Expectations About Off-Field Conduct and Bystander Intervention by U.S. College Football Players to Prevent Inappropriate Sexual Behavior},
  abstract = {The objective of the present study was to assess whether there is a positive association between expectations about off-field conduct set by the team coach and the likelihood that college football players intend to engage as prosocial bystanders in the prevention of what they consider to be inappropriate sexual behavior. In a sample of U.S. collegiate football players (N = 3,281), a path analysis model tested the association between coach expectations, perceived likelihood of discipline for off-field transgressions, and likelihood of intending to intervene to prevent inappropriate sexual behavior. Mediation of these relationships by the athleteâ€™s sense of exploitative entitlement and their attitudes about intervening were also assessed. Findings supported the hypothesized relationships, with expectations and discipline associated with bystander intentions both directly and indirectly through the mediating pathways of entitlement and attitudes about intervening. These findings provide evidence about the important role that sports team coaches can play in encouraging bystander intervention by clarifying expectations and consequences for conduct off the field of play. Athletic departments can provide a framework within which coaches are informed about the importance of setting and enforcing standards for off-field behavior, and are appropriately incentivized to do so.

  abstract = {This paper studied the relationship between performance and success of professional football teams. Teams' performances of the First (L1) and second (L2) division of Spanish football leagues in consecutive seasons, 2013-14 (T1) and 2014-15 (T2), were analyzed. For assessing performances, they were included the following keys (IR): a) as indicators of result (IRr) were annotated goals scored and conceded, and final behaviours like crosses and shots; and, b) as indicators of process (IRp) were recorded the game volume (passes and efficacy), collective use of the space, distance covered and variables involving set pieces. The success of the teams was valued considering the points scored at the end of the championship. The main results of the study were: 1) IR had different degrees of relationship with the success of the teams, being the IRr mostly related with to the points scored; 2) the relation between IRr or IRp and final accumulated points varied depending on the category of the teams, more offensive indicators in L1 and more defensive in L2 when were compared with the final output; and, 3) the IR unchanged from one season to another. This study supports the conclusion that use systematically IR (outcome and process) can be helpful in professional football, for knowing the particular performance that can approach a team to the success in a given league. Coaches could use this information, once contextualized to the team and league where they participate, in order to propose intervention's strategies that optimize the performance of the team.},

  title = {The effect of small-sided games with different levels of opposition on the tactical behaviour of young footballers with different levels of sport expertise},
  abstract = {To optimize playersâ€™ tactical abilities, coaches need to design training sessions with representative learning tasks, such as, small-sided games. Moreover, it is necessary to adapt the complexity of the tasks to the skill level of the athletes to maximally improve their perceptual, visual and attentive abilities. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of two teaching programs, each utilizing modified games with varied levels of opposition, on decision-making and action execution in young players with different levels of sports expertise. 19 football players (U12), separated into two ability groups (Average versus Low skill-level), participated in a series of training sessions that were spread over 4 phases: Pre-intervention 1, Intervention 1 (teaching program based on modified games with numerical superiority in attack), Pre-intervention 2 and Intervention 2 (teaching program based on modified games with numerical equality). Each intervention phase lasted 14 sessions. Decision-making and the execution of pass action during league matches over the same period were evaluated using the Game Performance Evaluation Tool (GPET). The Average skill-level group showed significant differences after the first intervention in decision-making and execution of the pass action (decision-making, p = .015; execution, p = .031), but not after the second intervention (decision-making, p = 1.000; execution, p = 1.000). For the Low skill-level group, significant differences were only observed in the execution of passing between the first and last phases (p = .014). These findings seem to indicate that for groups with an average level of expertise, training with numerical superiority in attack provides players with more time to make better decisions and to better execute actions. However, for lower-level groups programs may take longer to facilitate improvement. Nevertheless, numerical equality did not result in improvement for either group. Â© 2018 PrÃ¡xedes et al.

While exercise-based injury prevention programmes have successfully reduced injuries in other sports such as football, there is minimal research on this topic in rugby union. Objective To evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of an exercise-based intervention (BokSmart Safe Six) in junior rugby players that aims to reduce the injury risk profile and burden of injury. Setting 14-16-year-old junior rugby players in two geographically separated locations in South Africa over the 2017 rugby playing season. Methods A cluster-randomised controlled trial where the teams are allocated to groups that either (1) have a coach-delivered exercise intervention in their warm-up (BokSmart Safe Six) or (2) continue with their warm-up as usual' (control group). Injury risk profiles will be assessed through musculoskeletal screening on all players performed at the beginning, middle and end of the trial. Epidemiological measurements include injury surveillance at all matches and training sessions, and exposure to the various warm-up exercises (including BokSmart Safe Six exercises).

  abstract = {Head injuries are considered harmful in children. We analyzed head and neck injuries in organized football in 7- to 12-year-old children. Data for this analysis were obtained from a prospective cohort study over two consecutive football seasons in two European countries, and a randomized intervention trial over one season in four European countries. Football exposure and injuries were documented through an online database. Detailed information regarding injury characteristics and medical follow-up was retrieved from coaches, children and parents by phone. Thirty-nine head injuries and one neck injury (5% of all 791 injuries) were documented during 9933 player-seasons (total football exposure 688Â 045 hours). The incidence was 0.25 [95%CI 0.15, 0.35] head/neck injuries per 1000 match hours (N=23 match injuries) and 0.03 [95%CI 0.02, 0.03] per 1000 training hours. Eleven concussions (27.5%), nine head contusions (22.5%), eight lacerations or abrasions (20%), two nose fractures (2.5%), and two dental injuries (2.5%) occurred. The remaining eight injuries were nose bleeding or other minor injuries. Thirty injuries (75%) resulted from contact with another player, and ten injuries were due to collision with an object, falling or a hit by the ball. Whereas 70% of all head injuries (N=28) were due to frontal impacts, 73% of concussions (N=8) resulted from an impact to the occiput. The incidence and severity of head injuries in childrenâ€²s football are low. Coaches and parents, however, should be sensitized regarding the potential of concussions, particularly after an impact to the occiput. Â© 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

  title = {Optimization of the Hockey Fans in Training (Hockey FIT) weight loss and healthy lifestyle program for male hockey fans},
  abstract = {Background: The health outcomes of men continue to be poorer than women globally. Challenges in addressing this problem include difficulties engaging men in weight loss programs as they tend to view these programs as contrary to the masculine narrative of independence and self-reliance. Researchers have been turning towards sports fans to engage men in health promotion programs as sports fans are typically male, and tend to have poor health habits. Methods: Developed from the highly successful gender-sensitized Football Fans in Training program, Hockey Fans in Training (Hockey FIT) recruited 80 male hockey fans of the London Knights and Sarnia Sting who were overweight or obese into a weekly, 90-minute classroom education and group exercise program held over 12 weeks; a 40-week minimally-supported phase followed. A process evaluation of the Hockey FIT program was completed alongside a pragmatic randomized controlled trial and outcome evaluation in order to fully explore the acceptability of the Hockey FIT program from the perspectives of coaches delivering and participants engaged in the program. Data sources included attendance records, participant focus groups, coach interviews, assessment of fidelity (program observations and post-session coach reflections), and 12-month participant interviews. Results: Coaches enjoyed delivering the program and found it simple to deliver. Men valued being among others of similar body shape and similar weight loss goals, and found the knowledge they gained through the program helped them to make and maintain health behaviour changes. Suggested improvements include having more hockey-related information and activities, greater flexibility with timing of program delivery, and greater promotion of technology support tools. Conclusions: We confirmed Hockey FIT was an acceptable "gender-sensitized" health promotion program for male hockey fans who were overweight or obese. Minor changes were required for optimization, which will be evaluated in a future definitive trial. Trial registration: NCT02396524 (Clinicaltrials.gov). Date of registration: Feb 26, 2015.

  abstract = {Football training methodology has evolved greatly in recent years, including more increasingly specialized drills, with small-side games (SSG) taking on a prominent role. The objective of the current study was to analyze the effects that SSGs have on the physical condition of young football players during a six-week program. The study included 22 football players of two different age groups: U16 (n= 11, age: 15.8Â±0.3 years) and U18 (n= 11, age: 18.5Â±0.5 years). The participants were evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the intervention with the following tests: counter-movement jump (CMJ), 40 m sprint speed test (V40m) and endurance test "University of Montreal Track Test (UMTT)". The results showed significant improvements of the pre- to post-test on the CMJ (ES= 1.05Â± 0.13, 100%, 0%, 0%), V40m (ES= 0.29Â± 0.15, 0%, 16%, 84%) and UMTT (ES= 0.30Â± 0.20, 79%, 21%, 0%) p<0.05). With these results we can conclude that a program based on SSG, as well as progressive sequence and variety in the game formats in terms of the size and number of players on a team, can maintain and/or improve the physical condition of the players. One of the practical applications derived from the study is that the coaches can implement SSG to develop game tasks without neglecting the players' physical condition.},

  title = {We have the Programme, what next? Planning the implementation of an injury prevention programme},
  abstract = {Background and aim The impact of any injury prevention programme is a function of the programme and its implementation. However, real world implementation of injury prevention programmes is challenging. Lower limb injuries (LLIs) are common in community Australian football (community-AF) and it is likely that many could be prevented by implementing exercise-based warm-up programmes for players. This paper describes a systematic, evidence-informed approach used to develop the implementation plan for a LLI prevention programme in community-AF in Victoria, Australia. Methods An ecological approach, using Step 5 of the Intervention Mapping health promotion programme planning protocol, was taken. Results An implementation advisory group was established to ensure the implementation plan and associated strategies were relevant to the local context. Coaches were identified as the primary programme adopters and implementers within an ecological system including players, other coaches, first-aid providers, and club and league administrators. Social Cognitive Theory was used to identify likely determinants of programme reach, adoption and implementation among coaches (eg, knowledge, beliefs, skills and environment). Diffusion of Innovations theory, the Implementation Drivers framework and available research evidence were used to identify potential implementation strategies including the use of multiple communication channels, programme resources, coach education and mentoring. Conclusions A strategic evidence-informed approach to implementing interventions will help maximise their population impact. The approach to implementation planning described in this study relied on an effective researcher-practitioner partnership and active engagement of stakeholders. The identified implementation strategies were informed by theory, evidence and an in-depth understanding of the implementation context. Â© 2017, BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Background Injury risk in youth rugby has received much attention, highlighting the importance of establishing evidence-based injury reduction strategies. Aim To determine the efficacy of a movement control exercise programme in reducing injuries in youth rugby players and to investigate the effect of programme dose on injury measures. Methods In a cluster-randomised controlled trial, 40 independent schools (118 teams, 3188 players aged 14-18 years) were allocated to receive either the intervention or a reference programme, both of which were to be delivered by school coaches. The intervention comprised balance training, whole-body resistance training, plyometric training, and controlled rehearsal of landing and cutting manoeuvres. Time-loss (>24 hours) injuries arising from school rugby matches were recorded by coaches and medical staff. Results 441 time-loss match injuries (intervention, 233; control, 208) were reported across 15 938 match exposure-hours (intervention, 9083; control, 6855). Intention-to-treat results indicated unclear effects of trial arm on overall match injury incidence (rate ratio (RR)=0.85, 90% confidence limits 0.61 to 1.17), although clear reductions were evident in the intervention arm for concussion incidence (RR=0.71, 0.48 to 1.05). When trial arm comparisons were limited to teams who had completed three or more weekly programme sessions on average, clear reductions in overall match injury incidence (RR=0.28, 0.14 to 0.51) and concussion incidence (RR=0.41, 0.17 to 0.99) were noted in the intervention group. Conclusion A preventive movement control exercise programme can reduce match injury outcomes, including concussion, in schoolboy rugby players when compared with a standardised control exercise programme, although to realise the greatest effects players should complete the programme at least three times per week.

  abstract = {Background: EuroFIT is a gender-sensitised, health and lifestyle program targeting physical activity, sedentary time and dietary behaviours in men. The delivery of the program in football clubs, led by the clubs' community coaches, is designed to both attract and engage men in lifestyle change through an interest in football or loyalty to the club they support. The EuroFIT program will be evaluated in a multicentre pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT), for which ~1000 overweight men, aged 30-65 years, will be recruited in 15 top professional football clubs in the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and the UK. The process evaluation is designed to investigate how implementation within the RCT is achieved in the various football clubs and countries and the processes through which EuroFIT affects outcomes. Methods: This mixed methods evaluation is guided by the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance for conducting process evaluations of complex interventions. Data will be collected in the intervention arm of the EuroFIT trial through: participant questionnaires (n = 500); attendance sheets and coach logs (n = 360); observations of sessions (n = 30); coach questionnaires (n = 30); usage logs from a novel device for self-monitoring physical activity and non-sedentary behaviour (SitFIT); an app-based game to promote social support for physical activity outside program sessions (MatchFIT); interviews with coaches (n = 15); football club representatives (n = 15); and focus groups with participants (n = 30). Written standard operating procedures are used to ensure quality and consistency in data collection and analysis across the participating countries. Data will be analysed thematically within datasets and overall synthesis of findings will address the processes through which the program is implemented in various countries and clubs and through which it affects outcomes, with careful attention to the context of the football club. Discussion: The process evaluation will provide a comprehensive account of what was necessary to implement the EuroFIT program in professional football clubs within a trial setting and how outcomes were affected by the program. This will allow us to re-appraise the program's conceptual base, optimise the program for post-trial implementation and roll out, and offer suggestions for the development and implementation of future initiatives to promote health and wellbeing through professional sports clubs.

Identifying the physical fitness, anthropometric and athletic movement qualities discriminant of developmental level in elite junior Australian football: Implications for the development of talent. J Strength Cond Res 31(7): 1830-1839, 2017-This study aimed to identify the physical fitness, anthropometric and athletic movement qualities discriminant of developmental level in elite junior Australian football (AF). From a total of 77 players, 2 groups were defined according to their developmental level; under 16 (U16) (n = 40, 15.6 to 15.9 years), and U18 (n = 37, 17.1 to 17.9 years). Players performed a test battery consisting of 7 physical fitness assessments, 2 anthropometric measurements, and a fundamental athletic movement assessment. A multivariate analysis of variance tested the main effect of developmental level (2 levels: U16 and U18) on the assessment criterions, whilst binary logistic regression models and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were built to identify the qualities most discriminant of developmental level. A significant effect of developmental level was evident on 9 of the assessments (d = 0.27-0.88; p â‰¤ 0.05). However, it was a combination of body mass, dynamic vertical jump height (nondominant leg), repeat sprint time, and the score on the 20-m multistage fitness test that provided the greatest association with developmental level (Akaike's information criterion = 80.84). The ROC curve was maximized with a combined score of 180.7, successfully discriminating 89 and 60% of the U18 and U16 players, respectively (area under the curve = 79.3%). These results indicate that there are distinctive physical fitness and anthropometric qualities discriminant of developmental level within the junior AF talent pathway. Coaches should consider these differences when designing training interventions at the U16 level to assist with the development of prospective U18 AF players.

  title = {'It's like a personal motivator that you carried around wi' you': Utilising self-determination theory to understand men's experiences of using pedometers to increase physical activity in a weight management programme},
  abstract = {Background: Self-monitoring using pedometers is an effective behaviour change technique to support increased physical activity (PA). However, the ways in which pedometers operate as motivational tools in adoption and maintenance of PA is not well understood. This paper investigates men's experiences of pedometers as motivational tools both during and after their participation in a 12-week group-based, weight management programme for overweight/obese men, Football Fans in Training (FFIT). Methods: Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 28 men, purposively sampled to include men who did and did not achieve 5% weight loss during the programme. Data were analysed thematically utilising the framework approach, using Self-Determination Theory (SDT) - namely concepts of behavioural regulation and the basic needs of relatedness, competence and autonomy - as an analytical lens. Results: During the programme, FFIT's context and fellow participants supported relatedness and encouraged use of the pedometer. The pedometer was seen to provide tangible proof of progress, thus increasing competence for change, whilst the ability to monitor one's own progress and take remedial action supported autonomy; these men portrayed the pedometer as an 'ally'. However, a minority found the pedometer 'dispiriting' or controlling when it evidenced their inability to meet their PA targets. After the programme, some men no longer used the device as they had fully internalised their motivations for increased PA. In contrast, others continued to use pedometers or progressed to other self-monitoring technologies because it was enjoyable and facilitated maintenance of their increased PA. However, the minority of men who experienced the pedometer as controlling no longer used it. They were less successful in achieving 5% weight loss and appeared reliant on external factors, including support from coach and group members, to maintain motivation. Conclusion: These findings show how self-monitoring using pedometers and associated goal setting supported the development of autonomous motivation for PA, during and after participation in a group-based programme. They also suggest that programmes could focus on early identification of participants who remain motivated by extrinsic factors or express negative experiences of self-monitoring tools, to offer greater support to identify the benefits of PA based on a person's own values.

  title = {Community-Level Inequalities in Concussion Education of Youth Football Coaches},
  abstract = {Introduction USA Football has made the Heads Up Football (HUF) concussion education program available for coaches of youth football players. Existing evidence about the effectiveness of the HUF coach education program is equivocal. For HUF and other programs, there is growing concern that even effective interventions can increase inequalities if there is different uptake or impact by SES or other demographic factors. Understanding how adoption is patterned along these lines is important for understanding equity issues in youth football. This study tested the hypothesis that there will be lower adoption of HUF among coaches of youth football players in lower-SES communities. Methods The authors conducted a cross-sectional study of the association between community-level characteristics and number of USA Football youth league coaches who have completed HUF. Data were collected in 2014 and analyzed in 2015â€“2016. Results Implementation of the HUF program was patterned by community-level socioeconomic characteristics. Leagues located in communities with a higher percentage of families with children aged <18 years living below the poverty line and a smaller percentage of non-Hispanic white residents tended to have leagues with smaller percentages of HUF-certified coaches. Conclusions As interventions are developed that reduce the risks of youth football, it is important to consider not just the effectiveness of these interventions, but also whether they reduce or exacerbate health inequities. These results suggest that relying on voluntary adoption of coach education may result in inequitable implementation. Further study is required to identify and remedy organizational and contextual barriers to implementation of coach education in youth sport. Â© 2017 American Journal of Preventive Medicine},

  abstract = {Youth sport is a valuable context to foster the development of personal and social responsibility (PSR). Within competitive youth sport coaches face many challenges promoting PSR while still being required to win. However, information related to the role played by coaches in PSR development within competitive youth sport is scarce and thus additional research is required. The purpose of this study was to analyse the perceptions of youth coaches on delivering, and barriers to delivering PSR in competitive youth sport. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews conducted with 17 youth coaches who coached under-15 football teams in Portugal. A thematic analysis was performed which generated high (e.g. coaching practice) and low order categories (e.g. positive transference). The findings showed that coaches considered PSR development important in different developmental stages. The relationship between parents and coaches was identified as a key factor. Coaches experienced constraints to their intervention towards PSR development, such as challenging athlete behaviours which were resolved by implementing negative teaching strategies. Coaches also mentioned a low number of strategies to foster transference of PSR to other life domains. Â© 2016, Â© 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Effect of physical and psychosocial interventions on hormone and performance outcomes in professional rugby union players: a systematic review. J Strength Cond Res 31(11): 3158â€“3169, 2017â€”This systematic review investigates the acute effects of physical or psychosocial interventions on testosterone and cortisol responses in elite male rugby union players, and the subsequent association with physical performance areas (e.g., strength, power, sprint performance) or key performance indicators (e.g., coach-identified skills). Medline (via EBSCO), SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, InformIT, ProQuest, Cochrane, and Scopus were searched for relevant articles. Nine articles met the inclusion criteria, with 6 articles examining the effect of speed, strength or power training, and the remaining 3 psychosocial interventions. Quality assessment of the articles as determined by their PEDro score was either 6 or 7 out of 11. This review found that both physical and psychosocial interventions can alter testosterone and cortisol, and physical performance areas important for rugby union are affected by these changes. The limited literature in the field supports the notion that physical interventions of short duration and high intensity, and psychosocial interventions that create a positive environment may elicit a hormonal response that is associated with favorable performance outcomes. Studies that reported psychosocial interventions suggest that testosterone and cortisol may be altered in elite rugby players without metabolic stress, something of great interest to elite athletes and coaches who are looking to elicit a performance advantage without increasing athlete load. Overall, this review identified that when the testosterone responses to an intervention are notably greater than that of cortisol, favorable outcomes are likely. Further research is required to improve our understanding on how to best manipulate training to induce these favorable changes. Â© 2017 National Strength and Conditioning Association.},

  abstract = {Negra, Y, Chaabene, H, Sammoud, S, Bouguezzi, R, Mkaouer, B, Hachana, Y, and Granacher, U. Effects of plyometric training on components of physical fitness in prepuberal male soccer athletes: the role of surface instability. J Strength Cond Res 31(12): 3295â€“3304, 2017â€”Previous studies contrasted the effects of plyometric training (PT) conducted on stable vs. unstable surfaces on components of physical fitness in child and adolescent soccer players. Depending on the training modality (stable vs. unstable), specific performance improvements were found for jump (stable PT) and balance performances (unstable PT). In an attempt to combine the effects of both training modalities, this study examined the effects of PT on stable surfaces compared with combined PT on stable and unstable surfaces on components of physical fitness in prepuberal male soccer athletes. Thirty-three boys were randomly assigned to either a PT on stable surfaces (PTS; n = 17; age = 12.1 6 0.5 years; height = 151.6 6 5.7 cm; body mass = 39.2 6 6.5 kg; and maturity offset = 22.3 6 0.5 years) or a combined PT on stable and unstable surfaces (PTC; n = 16; age = 12.2 6 0.6 years; height = 154.6 6 8.1 cm; body mass = 38.7 6 5.0 kg; and maturity offset = 22.2 6 0.6 years). Both intervention groups conducted 4 soccer-specific training sessions per week combined with either 2 PTS or PTC sessions. Before and after 8 weeks of training, proxies of muscle power (e.g., countermovement jump [CMJ], standing long jump [SLJ]), muscle strength (e.g., reactive strength index [RSI]), speed (e.g., 20-m sprint test), agility (e.g., modified Illinois change of direction test [MICODT]), static balance (e.g., stable stork balance test [SSBT]), and dynamic balance (unstable stork balance test [USBT]) were tested. An analysis of covariance model was used to test between-group differences (PTS vs. PTC) at posttest using baseline outcomes as covariates. No significant between-group differences at posttest were observed for CMJ (p . 0.05, d = 0.41), SLJ (p . 0.05, d = 0.36), RSI (p . 0.05, d = 0.57), 20-m sprint test (p . 0.05, d = 0.06), MICODT (p . 0.05, d = 0.23), and SSBT (p . 0.05, d = 0.20). However, statistically significant between-group differences at posttest were noted for the USBT (p, 0.01, d = 1.49) in favor of the PTC group. For most physical fitness tests (except RSI), significant pre-to-post improvements were observed for both groups (p, 0.01, d = 0.55â€“3.96). Eight weeks of PTS or PTC resulted in similar performance improvements in components of physical fitness except for dynamic balance. From a performance-enhancing perspective, PTC is recommended for pediatric strength and conditioning coaches because it produced comparable training effects as PTS on proxies of muscle power, muscle strength, speed, agility, static balance, and additional effects on dynamic balance.

  abstract = {There is limited published research on strength and conditioning (S&C) practices in elite rugby union (RU). Information regarding testing batteries and programme design would provide valuable information to both applied practitioners and researchers investigating the influence of training interventions or preperformance strategies. The aim of this study was to detail the current practices of S&C coaches and sport scientists working in RU. A questionnaire was developed that comprised 7 sections: Personal details, physical testing, strength and power development, concurrent training, flexibility development, unique aspects of the programme, and any further relevant information regarding prescribed training programmes. Forty-three (41 men, 2 women; age: 33.1 6 5.3 years) of 52 (83%) coaches responded to the questionnaire. The majority of practitioners worked with international level and/or professional RU athletes. All respondents believed strength training benefits RU performance and reported that their athletes regularly performed strength training. The clean and back squat were rated the most important prescribed exercises. Forty-one (95%) respondents reported prescribing plyometric exercises and 38 (88%) indicated that periodization strategies were used. Forty-two (98%) practitioners reported conducting physical testing, with body composition being the most commonly tested phenotype. Thirty-three (77%) practitioners indicated that the potential muted strength development associated with concurrent training was considered when programming and 27 (63%) believed that strength before aerobic training was more favorable for strength development than vice versa. This research represents the only published survey to date of S&C practices in northern and southern hemisphere RU. Â© 2016 National Strength and Conditioning Association Unauthorized.},

  abstract = {Background: Effective approaches that engage men in weight loss and lifestyle change are important because of worldwide increases, including in Canada, in obesity and chronic diseases. Football Fans in Training (FFIT), developed in Scotland, successfully tackled these problems by engaging overweight/obese male football fans in sustained weight loss and positive health behaviours, through program deliveries at professional football stadia. Methods: Aims: 1) Adapt FFIT to hockey within the Canadian context and integrate with HealtheStepsâ„¢ (evidence-based lifestyle program) to develop Hockey Fans in Training (Hockey FIT); 2) Explore potential for Hockey FIT to help overweight/obese men lose weight and improve other outcomes by 12 weeks, and retain these improvements to 12 months; 3) Evaluate feasibility of recruiting and retaining overweight/obese men; 4) Evaluate acceptability of Hockey FIT; and 5) Conduct program optimization via a process evaluation. We conducted a two-arm pilot pragmatic randomized controlled trial (pRCT) whereby 80 overweight/obese male hockey fans (35-65 years; body-mass index â‰¥28 kg/m2) were recruited through their connection to two junior A hockey teams (London and Sarnia, ON) and randomized to Intervention (Hockey FIT) or Comparator (Wait-List Control). Hockey FIT includes a 12-week Active Phase (classroom instruction and exercise sessions delivered weekly by trained coaches) and a 40-week Maintenance Phase. Data collected at baseline and 12 weeks (both groups), and 12 months (Intervention only), will inform evaluation of the potential of Hockey FIT to help men lose weight and improve other health outcomes. Feasibility and acceptability will be assessed using data from self-reports at screening and baseline, program fidelity (program observations and coach reflections), participant focus group discussions, coach interviews, as well as program questionnaires and interviews with participants. This information will be analyzed to inform program optimization. Discussion: Hockey FIT is a gender-sensitive program designed to engage overweight/obese male hockey fans to improve physical activity and healthy eating choices, thereby leading to weight loss and other positive changes in health outcomes.

  title = {Discriminating talent identified junior Australian footballers using a fundamental gross athletic movement assessment},
  abstract = {Talent identification (TID) is a pertinent component of the sports sciences, affording practitioners the opportunity to target developmental interventions to a select few; optimising financial investments. However, TID is multi-componential, requiring the recognition of immediate and prospective performance. The measurement of athletic movement skill may afford practitioners insight into the latter component given its augmented relationship with functional sport specific qualities. It is currently unknown whether athletic movement skill is a discriminant quality in junior Australian football (AF). This study aimed to discriminate talent identified junior AF players from their non-talent identified counterparts using a fundamental gross athletic movement assessment. From a total of 50 under 18 (U18) AF players; two groups were classified a priori based on selection level; talent identified (n = 25; state academy representatives) and non-talent identified (n = 25; state-based competition repre-sentatives). Players performed a fundamental gross athletic movement assessment based on the Athletic Ability Assessment (AAA), consisting of an overhead squat, double lunge (left and right legs), single leg Romanian deadlift (left and right legs), and a push up (six movement criterions). Movements were scored across three assessment points using a three-point scale (resulting in a possible score of nine for each movement). A multivariate analysis of variance revealed significant between group effects on four of the six movement criterions (d = 0.56 â€“ 0.87; p = 0.01 â€“ 0.02). Binary logistic regression models and a receiver operating characteristic curve inspection revealed that the overhead squat score provided the greatest group discrimination (Î²(SE) = -0.89(0.44); p < 0.05), with a score of 4.5 classifying 64% and 88% of the talent identified and non-talent identified groups, respectively. Results support the integration of this assessment into contemporary talent identification approaches in junior AF, as it may provide coaches with insight into a juniors developmental potential.

  abstract = {Background: Lifestyle interventions targeting physical activity, sedentary time and dietary behaviours have the potential to initiate and support behavioural change and result in public health gain. Although men have often been reluctant to engage in such lifestyle programs, many are at high risk of several chronic conditions. We have developed an evidence and theory-based, gender sensitised, health and lifestyle program (European Fans in Training (EuroFIT)), which is designed to attract men through the loyalty they feel to the football club they support. This paper describes the study protocol to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the EuroFIT program in supporting men to improve their level of physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour over 12 months. Methods: The EuroFIT study is a pragmatic, two-arm, randomised controlled trial conducted in 15 football clubs in the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and the UK (England). One-thousand men, aged 30 to 65 years, with a self-reported Body Mass Index (BMI) â‰¥27 kg/m2 will be recruited and individually randomised. The primary outcomes are objectively-assessed changes in total physical activity (steps per day) and total sedentary time (minutes per day) at 12 months after baseline assessment. Secondary outcomes are weight, BMI, waist circumference, resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cardio-metabolic blood biomarkers, food intake, self-reported physical activity and sedentary time, wellbeing, self-esteem, vitality and quality of life. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed and a process evaluation conducted. The EuroFIT program will be delivered over 12 weekly, 90-minute sessions that combine classroom discussion with graded physical activity in the setting of the football club. Classroom sessions provide participants with a toolbox of behaviour change techniques to initiate and sustain long-term lifestyle changes. The coaches will receive two days of training to enable them to create a positive social environment that supports men in engaging in sustained behaviour change. Discussion: The EuroFIT trial will provide evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the EuroFIT program delivered by football clubs to their male fans, and will offer insight into factors associated with success in making sustained changes to physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and secondary outcomes, such as diet.

  abstract = {In this paper we use a social practice approach to explore men's experience of Football Fans in Training (FFIT), a group-based weight management programme for men that harnesses men's symbolic attachment to professional football clubs to engage them in lifestyle change. FFIT is delivered by community coaches in clubsâ€™ stadia and is gender-sensitised in relation to context, content and style of delivery. Using a â€˜toolkitâ€™ of concepts from the work of Bourdieu, Goffman and Durkheim we analysed data from 13 focus group discussions with participants, and fieldwork notes from programme observations to investigate the appeal and success of FFIT, and how it worked to support change. Our analysis builds on our work on the importance of shared symbolic commitment to the football club and being with â€˜men like meâ€™ to understand how the interaction context facilitated â€˜effervescentâ€™ experiences. These experiences encouraged men to make changes to their diet and physical activity, talk about them, practice performing them and implement them in their lives. Thus a social practice approach illuminated the social processes through which lifestyle change was achieved, and we argue that it can deepen and enrich both intervention design and evaluation.

  abstract = {Despite the call to improve health promotion (HP) in sport clubs in the existing literature, little is known about sport clubs' organizational capacity. Grounded within the setting-based framework, this study compares HP activities and guidance among 10 football clubs. At least three grassroots coaches from each club (n 68) completed the Health Promoting Sports Clubs scale to assess their perceptions of HP; an official (n10) was interviewed about club's activities and official's guidance provided to coaches. A concurrent embedded design with quantitative results guiding the qualitative analysis was used. Despite no significant differences regarding coaches' perceptions of HP between the 10 sport clubs, except for the policy dimension, officials' interviews revealed some contradictions. Sport participation was recognized as automatically promoting HP, meaning that sport practice entails many benefits, without questioning the nature of the activities. HP was considered as a secondary aim in regard to sport performance, leading to the lack of written policies, partnerships and sporadic HP activities. Future interventions should consider: (i) the creation of required policy and long-Term vision; (ii) the link between HP and sport performance; (iii) the rootedness of sport clubs within their community and (iv) guidelines towards HP from sport federations.

  abstract = {Research Question(s): Talent selection is a stepping stone to sporting success at national and international levels. The research questions that guided this study were: (a) What is the decision-making (DM) process that coaches (as key selectors) use during talent selection? and (b) In what ways does awareness of the relative age effect (RAE) influence their DM? Research Methods: This study employed an action research approach in order to raise coach awareness of RAE on talent selection to examine the decisions surrounding selection of players. From a sample of 263 male football (soccer) players (age range 12â€“15) and 4 coaches, qualitative and quantitative data were collected on coach decisions for selection of players and frequencies of selected players in birth-months. Secondary data were also gathered from previous year's selections. Results and Findings: Logistic regression showed that coachesâ€™ awareness of RAE did not eliminate nor reduce it. In-depth interviews revealed that coachesâ€™ DM was influenced by preconceptions and various pressures to select certain players. Pressures resonated within the volatile nature of their profession and career goals, the existence of competing decision-makers such as peers and parents, and the tension to select players for immediate success. Implications: The results lead to the consideration of various practical recommendations on coach organisation, coach education and alternative interventions in DM such as an alternative staged approach to talent selection that lends itself open for future research.

  abstract = {Objectives: To assess high school (HS) football players' knowledge of concussions and to determine whether increased knowledge is correlated with better attitudes toward reporting concussion symptoms and abstaining from play. Design: Two survey tools were used to assess athletes' knowledge and attitudes about concussions. Surveys collected information about demographics, knowledge about concussions, and attitudes about playing sports after a concussion. All athletes present completed one of the 2 surveys. A knowledge and attitude score for each survey was calculated. Frequencies and mean values were used to characterize the population; regression analysis, analysis of variance, and t tests were used to look for associations. Setting: A football camp for HS athletes in the Cincinnati area. Participants: Male HS football players from competitive football programs in the Cincinnati area. Intervention: None. Main Outcome Measure: Scores on knowledge and attitude sections; responses to individual questions. Results: One hundred twenty (100%) athletes were enrolled although not every athlete responded to every question. Thirty (25%) reported history of a concussion; 82 (70%) reported receiving prior concussion education. More than 75% correctly recognized all concussion symptoms that were asked, except "feeling in a fog" [n = 63 (53%)]. One hundred nine (92%) recognized a risk of serious injury if they return to play too quickly. Sixty-four (54%) athletes would report symptoms of a concussion to their coach; 62 (53%) would continue to play with a headache from an injury. There was no association between knowledge score and attitude score (P = 0.08). Conclusions: Despite having knowledge about the symptoms and danger of concussions, many HS football athletes in our sample did not have a positive attitude toward reporting symptoms or abstaining from play after a concussion. Clinical Relevance: Physicians should be aware that young athletes may not report concussion symptoms. Copyright Â© 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Political interventions, media coverage and research often refer to the underrepresentation of ethnic minorities, particularly girls and women, participating in physical activity and organised sports. In both public and academic debates, reference is made to the religious culture as a particular barrier to participation in sports among Muslim girls and women. This article aims to provide a counter-narrative by focusing on young Muslim girls who simultaneously practice their religion and sports. The main research question was: How do young Danish Muslim girls align participation in sports with their religious and cultural frames of reference? The study uses a case study approach with interviews of ten 13â€“17-year-old Danish Muslim girls, as well as explorative observations in two football clubs and interviews with five coaches and club leaders. In further developing an analytical model for interpreting religion as hegemonic, embodied and dynamic cultural phenomena, the analysis points to the diversity through which Muslim girls and women participate and engage in sports. Finally, the article discusses the extent to which counter-narratives may contribute to changing perspectives on so-called hard to reach target groups. Â© 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

  title = {Effectiveness of a community football programme on improving physiological markers of health in a hard-to-reach male population: the role of exercise intensity},
  abstract = {The present study evaluated the effectiveness of participation in recreational football during a community health programme, on physiological markers of health within a hard to reach population. Nine men (Age: 33Â Â±Â 9Â years, Mass: 75.4Â Â±Â 13.7Â kg, Height: 1.74Â Â±Â 0.07Â m and Body Fat: 19Â Â±Â 2%) were recruited to participate in the study in collaboration with an English Premier League Football Club. Participants completed the 12-week football-based programme which included two coached football sessions each week. Physiological tests for blood pressure, resting heart rate, cholesterol and an anthropometrical test for body composition were completed at three time points during the study (Weeks â€“ 1, 6 and 12) in an attempt to evaluate the impact of the intervention on health. During each training session, measurements of intensity (%HRmax, identified from the yoyo intermittent level 1 test), duration and rating of perceived exertion were made. The 12-week programme (mean HRmax throughout programmeÂ =Â 75Â Â±Â 4% beatsÂ minâˆ’1; mean RPE throughout programmeÂ =Â 6Â Â±Â 1) elicited few changes in physiological markers of health with the only significant change been a decrease in resting heart rate from weeks 6 to 12 (87Â Â±Â 22 beatsÂ minâˆ’1 at week-6, to 72Â Â±Â 17 beatsÂ minâˆ’1; pÂ &lt;Â 0.05). These data would suggest that the current community football-related health project was not effective in improving physiological markers of health, but was able to maintain their level of health. A lack of improvement may be due to the low intensity of sessions and a lack of coach education for the promotion of sessions that aim to improve health. Â© 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

  title = {Exploring coach behaviours, session contexts and key stakeholder perceptions of non-linear coaching approaches in youth sport},
  abstract = {Gaining better understanding of coaching pedagogies remains a crucial aspect of developing practice. In particular, pedagogic strategies which do not follow transmission-based, technically focused, approaches have been underinvestigated. Furthermore, most investigations into coaching processes have elicited an incomplete understanding of the respective pedagogies due to deficiencies in the methodology such as limited triangulation of methods. This study utilises two systematic observation instruments, field notes, individual coach interviews and parent group interviews in order to investigate non-linear coaching pedagogies in three youth sport environments. The systematic observation instruments revealed a lower rate of coach behaviour than has previously been reported alongside fewer technical interventions and more questioning. The qualitative data revealed three themes; creating an environment of participant centredness, holistic development and authentically situated learning. The methodology effectively elicited understanding of the coaches' pedagogic strategies. Future research should utilise such methodologies to investigate other sporting environments such as in elite and disability sport, particularly studying those approaches which feature non-linear pedagogies.

  title = {The challenge and impact of engaging hard-to-reach populations in regular physical activity and health behaviours: an examination of an English Premier League â€˜Football in the Communityâ€™ men's health programme},
  abstract = {Objectives To investigate the challenges that men from hard-to-reach (HTR) populations encounter when attempting to commit to regular participation in physical activity and health behaviours, and to explore the psychological and social effects of participation in a twelve week football-led health improvement intervention. Study design A twelve week football specific physical activity intervention targeting men from HTR populations was delivered by Everton Football Clubs' Football in the Community (FitC) scheme as part of a national programme of men's health delivered in/by English Premier League (EPL) football clubs. Men living in homeless shelters and/or recovering from substance misuse were recruited over a period of three months. The programme consisted of a two hour football session, twice weekly, alongside the dissemination of healthy living messages. Football sessions were conducted by a qualified FitC coach. Methods This research was conducted during a twelve week period of immersed practitioner-research. Ethnographic and observational methodologies were adopted. Psychosocial issues were discussed with participants through informal clientâ€“researcher interactions and data were logged via field notes. Records of attendance were logged. Participants who failed to attend a session were contacted and their reason(s) for non-attendance were recorded. Data were analysed using deductive and inductive reasoning. Results Despite the apparent ambition of the participants to regularly participate in the FitC programme, adherence to the programme was poor. Economic, environmental and social barriers to engagement in the programme were apparent. Engagement in the programme resulted in positive psychosocial developments; the development of structure, social interaction and social capital. Conclusion Community based football-led health improvement programmes endorsed by professional football clubs appear well positioned to connect with, and attract, men from HTR populations. The evidence suggests that such programmes can improve psychosocial health amongst these populations. However, a bottom-up programme design and management strategy is required in order to reduce the challenges facing HTR participants when attempting to regularly engage in physical activity and health behaviours.

  abstract = {Objective: To investigate knowledge, attitude, and awareness of appropriate mouthguard use, as well as the management of traumatic dental injuries (TDIs). Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Community survey. Participants: Four hundred ninety-four junior rugby league players and their coaches in the Gold Coast, Australia. Interventions: Data were collected anonymously during training sessions by means of a survey questionnaire, followed by a presentation on mouthguards and the management of TDIs. Main Outcome Measures: Descriptive statistics on the frequency distribution of the demographic characteristics, knowledge, and use of mouthguards as well as the relationships between the type of mouthguard worn and questions related to mouthguard use. Results: The majority of players surveyed reported wearing a mouthguard (68.2%). Cost (40.1%) and not believing that they work (35.7%) were listed as the main reasons for not doing so. The boil-and-bite type was the most used by players (64.7%). Almost 44% of coaches and 50% of players responded that only a dentist can manage an avulsed tooth, that a tooth had to be reinserted within 15 minutes (40.6% and 21.9%, respectively), and that either water or milk can be used to transport an avulsed tooth to the dentist (100% and 82.2%, respectively). Conclusions: Education related to the correct use of mouthguards and the management of TDIs should be ongoing for players, their caregivers, and their coaches and should be required as part of the training of coaches to prevent injury in rugby league. Clinical Relevance: This study found that although the overwhelming majority of junior rugby league coaches encourage the wearing of mouthguards, only two-thirds of the players do so. Players' compliance to wear mouthguards is largely influenced by their perception of efficacy and its comfort. Educational campaigns with involvement of dental practitioners, related to the correct use of mouthguards and the management of TDIs, should be ongoing for players, their caregivers, and their coaches and should also be required as part of the training of coaches.

  abstract = {Objective: To describe visual problems among athletes with intellectual disabilities (IDs) and the role of vision in special sports. Design: A cross-sectional observational study. Setting: Athletes participating in Special Olympics European Summer Games 2010 in Warsaw attended vision screening by Special Olympics Lions Clubs International Opening Eyes. Participants: Coaches were encouraged to bring all athletes to screening without selection; 900 athletes from 52 European countries participated. Interventions: Standard noninvasive eye examination procedures. Independent variables were age, gender, sport, and country of origin. Main Outcome Measures: Eyeglasses wear, presenting visual acuity, refractive error, and ocular health. Results: Testability rates were very high. Findings confirmed high prevalence of ocular/visual defects in people with ID. There was an association between acuity and sport discipline. Few athletes used sports glasses. Screening revealed a lack of eye care even in the most developed nations. Conclusions: The impact of vision on sports activity in athletes with ID is significant. More needs to be done to ensure good vision and safety correction for active people with ID. Better provision and greater awareness of eye care in people with ID is needed in all European societies. Clinical Relevance: Data presented highlight the need for increased awareness of the role of vision in sporting achievements, personal development, and quality of life in active people with ID. Athletes with ID should have easily accessible comprehensive eye care, and when appropriate, corrective and protective glasses. This will require the efficient cooperation of vision specialists, coaches, carers, and athletes themselves. Â© 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.},

  title = {Comprehensive Coach Education Reduces Head Impact Exposure in American Youth Football},
  abstract = {Background: Despite little evidence that defines a threshold of head impact exposure or that participation in youth sports leads to long-term cognitive impairments, it is prudent to identify methods of reducing the frequency of head impacts. Purpose: To compare the mean number of head impacts between youth football players in practice and games between leagues that implemented the Heads Up Football (HUF) educational program and those that did not (NHUF). Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: During the 2014 season, head impact exposure was measured using xPatch accelerometers from 70 youth football players aged 8 to 15 years from 5 leagues. Data were collected during both games and practices. The NHUF group comprised 32 players from 8 teams within 3 leagues. The HUF group comprised 38 players from 7 teams within 2 leagues. Independent-sample t tests evaluated differences in head impact exposure across groups (ie, HUF and NHUF). Results: Players (mean Â± SD: age, 11.7 Â± 1.4 years; height, 152.2 Â± 10.5 cm; weight, 51.6 Â± 9.6 kg) experienced a total of 7478 impacts over 10g, of which 4250 (56.8%) and 3228 (43.2%) occurred in practices and games, respectively. The majority of impacts occurred within the NHUF group (62.0%), followed by the HUF group (38.0%). With a 10g impact threshold, the mean number of impacts during practice per individual event was lower in the HUF group (mean Â± SD, 5.6 Â± 2.9) than in the NHUF group (mean Â± SD, 8.9 Â± 3.1; difference, 3.4; 95% CI, 2.9-3.9). This difference was attenuated when the threshold was changed to 20g but remained significant (difference, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7-1.3). At both the 10g and 20g impact thresholds, no differences were found in games. Conclusion: Players who participated in HUF leagues accumulated fewer head impacts per practice at both the 10g and 20g thresholds. Youth football leagues should consider the HUF educational program, while exploring additional interventions, to help reduce the number of head impacts in players. Â© 2015, Â© The Author(s) 2015.},

  abstract = {Home advantage in seven American college team sports (baseball, basketball, football, hockey, lacrosse, soccer and women's basketball) was compared with professional leagues in the United States for the same sports and for the same time period. A total of 81,063 college games and 22,477 professional games were analyzed for the four seasons 2006-07 to 2009-10. There was a significant home advantage, as measured by home winning percentage, in all sports, both college and professional. The overall home advantage in college sports was significantly greater than in professional sports (p<0.015). The mean difference was 3.73 home winning percentage points, being greatest for baseball, basketball, and hockey (all p<0.001). Plausible explanations for these results include differences in college and professional competition in terms of familiarity with local conditions, referee bias, territoriality and psychological factors. However, the influence of travel fatigue was inconclusive. Only for soccer was the home advantage greater for professionals. This was the only sport where crowd size appeared to be having an effect. In addition the rules of college soccer allow more substitution and hence greater coach intervention than in professional soccer, a factor that could also be reducing home advantage.},

  abstract = {Objectives: The "Mayday Safety Procedure" (MSP) is included in the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) Medical and Safety Recommendations and the mandatory SmartRugby training for coaches. Previous research indicates that translating the Mayday Safety Procedure into practice among community rugby coaches is challenging. This study investigated whether Mayday Safety Procedure translation could be enhanced by systematically planning and implementing a range of theory-informed and context-specific diffusion strategies. Design: A controlled before-and-after study. Methods: Coaches of senior community rugby teams in five zones in New South Wales (Australia) were invited to complete a questionnaire about their Mayday Safety Procedure knowledge and practice at the end of the 2010 and 2011 rugby seasons. During 2011, coaches in the intervention zone were exposed to a range of strategies to promote Mayday Safety Procedure diffusion which were planned by following Step 5 of the Intervention Mapping protocol. Coaches in the other four zones were exposed to usual strategies to promote Mayday Safety Procedure diffusion. Results: Using the RE-AIM evaluation framework, statistically significant improvements were found among intervention zone coaches in: knowledge of most Mayday Safety Procedure key criteria; the number of coaches recognising their zone policy requiring them to train players in the Mayday Safety Procedure; frequency of provision of Mayday Safety Procedure training to players; coach perceptions of the quality of Mayday Safety Procedure training for players; and in confidence that referees could implement the Mayday Safety Procedure during a game if required. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the translation of injury prevention policy into community practice can be enhanced by developing and implementing a theory-informed, context-specific diffusion plan, undertaken in partnership with key stakeholders.

Four out of the five coaches also increased the use of total questioning behaviour. Second, interviews revealed how video feedback gave structure to reflective conversations that improved self-awareness and provided a trigger for behaviour change. The coaches highlighted how video-based reflection challenged their current understanding and enabled a range of learning sources to support and inform changed coach behaviour.

  abstract = {Purpose â€“ The health promoting benefits of sport participation are under-utilized and should be further developed, particularly at the grassroots level. The purpose of this paper is to examine how grassroots coaches in youth football perceive their coaching practices after participating in a community-based coach education program aimed at optimizing their experiences in youth sport, namely the Empowering Coachingâ„¢ training program, based on self-determination theory (SDT) and achievement goal theory (AGT). It compares French and Norwegian coaches to suggest whether the principles of the Empowering Coachingâ„¢ training program can be applied successfully in the two countries. Design/methodology/approach â€“ The Empowering Coachingâ„¢ training program is a six hour workshop and was delivered at the beginning of the 2011 football season. At the end of the season, the grassroots coachesâ€™ reflections on their coaching practices were examined through a qualitative approach with in-depth interviews of 18 coaches in France and Norway, applying a hybrid analyses and comparing country-wise. Findings â€“ All coaches expressed the intention to embrace the philosophy of the program, and to apply several of the strategies they had learnt during the workshop. The coaches perceived that the program supported their efforts to develop and implement strategies to stimulate intrinsic motivation, enjoyment and long-term participation among the players. There were some differences between coaches from France and Norway (e.g. rules and involvement), but the similarities were more evident, supporting the universality of applying SDT in the youth sport setting. Social implications â€“ The findings are encouraging for sport as a health promoting setting and for the development of the personal skills in grassroot coaches, as they imply that coaches who feel competent in how to structure practices and matches that provide the players with positive sport experiences are likely to enable players to feel supported and motivated. Originality/value â€“ This study explores qualitatively the impact of an intervention based on SDT and AGT, focussing on football coachesâ€™ reflections on their coaching practices.

Results showed that CEs were keen to participate in this project (16/18; 89%), to stay involved (12/16; 75%), and to diffuse the principles after the research project (12/12; 100%). CE training seemed effective as results indicated that CEs applied the principles of the program during the workshops and covered a high degree of the content (78%). Cross-cultural differences were found as the French Football Federation CE dropped out of the program, as Norwegian CEs delivered the content with higher fidelity and had higher enjoyment and pace scores than French CEs.

To recognize the scientific evidence of the effectiveness of exercise intervention programs in the prevention of hamstring injuries, in male football players. Different studies were selected for revision from several databases. To evaluate the methodological quality of these studies we used the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) and determined the strength of the evidence using the best evidence synthesis grading system. The used exercise programs where based in concentric and eccentric strength, the eccentric strength exercise Nordic Hamstrings, The FIFA 11+, and flexibility exercises. The variables studied were: the incidence, the incidence of new injuries, recurrence of injuries, the severity, and the risk of injuries. The concentric and eccentric strength program and the Nordic Hamstrings program seem to be the most effective in reducing the incidence of injuries and the incidence of new injuries, respectively (limited evidence). The Nordic Hamstrings program does not reduce the risk of injuries (limited evidence) and does not improve the level of severity of the injuries (moderate evidence). The FIFA 11+program does not reduce the incidence of injuries (limited evidence). There are contradictory evidences on the other variables. Â© 2015, Redprint Editora Ltda. All Rights Reserved},

  abstract = {Background: American football is an extremely physical game with amuch higher risk of injury than other sports. Whilemany studies have reported the rate of injury for particular body regions or for individual injuries, very little information exists that compares the incidence or severity of particular injuries within a body region. Such information is critical for prioritizing preventative interventions. Purpose: To retrospectively analyze epidemiological data to identify the most common and most severe foot and ankle injuries in collegiate menâ€™s football. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: Injury data were obtained from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Injury Surveillance System (ISS) for all foot and ankle injuries during the 2004-2005 to 2008-2009 seasons. Injuries were analyzed in terms of incidence and using multiple measures of severity (time loss, surgeries, medical disqualifications). This frequency and severity information is summarized in tabular form as well as in a 4 Ã— 4 quantitative injury risk assessment matrix (QIRAM). Results: The rate of foot and ankle injuries was 15 per 10,000 athletic exposures (AEs). Five injuries were found to be responsible for more than 80% of all foot and ankle injuries: lateral ankle ligament sprains, syndesmotic (high ankle) sprains, medial ankle ligament sprains, midfoot injuries, and first metatarsophalangeal joint injuries. Ankle dislocations were found to be the most severe in terms of median time loss (100 days), percentage of surgeries (83%), and percentage of medical disqualifications (94%), followed by metatarsal fractures (38 days, 36%, and 49%, respectively) and malleolus fractures (33 days, 41%, and 59%, respectively). Statistical analysis suggests that the 3 measures of severity are highly correlated (r > 0.94), thereby justifying the use of time loss as a suitable proxy for injury severity in the construction of the QIRAM. Conclusion: Based on the QIRAM analysis, the 5 highest risk injuries were identified based on both incidence and severity (ankle dislocations, syndesmotic sprains, lateral ankle ligament sprains, metatarsal fractures, and malleolus fractures).

  abstract = {Purpose. The objective of the present study to analyse the styles of coping with stress and the locus of control (LOC) in specific sporting situations of female football players and seeking relationships between the analysed variables. Methods. The study included 50 female football players aged 16-18 years. Two psychological instruments were administered: the Polish language Questionnaire for Examining Locus of Control in Sports Activity (PKSPwS) and the Polish version of the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS). Results. The mean level of the investigated LOC dimensions as well as the styles of coping with stress showed that behaviour associated with avoidance and emotions predominated over task-oriented style. However, taskoriented style was positively related to the locus of control in specific situations that occur in sport. Conclusions. The results of the study suggest that social support and educational initiatives adapted to female athletes are required. These include mental training and the psycho-pedagogical intervention of coaches, where emphasis should be placed on enhancing internal locus of control as well as the development and improvement of effective stress-coping styles.

Our results show that football coaches utilise different methodologies depending on the training they received. It should be noted that coaches who have a university degree in the area of Physical and Sports Education attach more importance to content related to Physical Education and use inclusive methodologies to a greater extent, while coaches who have completed sports training courses or have the sports instructor qualification attach more importance to specific content and directive methodologies. In this way, when the coach has received university training in the area of Physical and Sports Education, he or she is more likely to break with traditional models of intervention.},

Continued research is needed to determine if the IRs, in youth football, are consistently reduced by implementation of the program. Further research is needed to examine the impact of coaches taking and implementing the program on the reduction of injuries in other youth sports.},

However, within soccer many of these programs have been delivered as workshops, homework tasks, or individual consultations with athletes. The aim of the project was to develop an ecological intervention by creating a series of drillbased sessions to train psychological skills, and educate coaches about how to implement and integrate PST as a natural part of daily training. The program was delivered to the youth academies in nine Danish professional soccer clubs and consisted of three phases: (a) planning of the program, (b) education and designing soccer drills, and (c) delivery of the drills on the soccer pitch. The program was well received by clubs, coaches, and players. With regards to project aims, the intervention was generally considered a success. Coaches reported that the drill-based nature of the program was practical and relevant to young players' development of psychological skills and many players and coaches have continued working with this approach. However, success varied across the nine clubs and was influenced by factors such as the clubs' willingness and capacity to adopt new concepts, the presentation of sport psychology in soccer language, and time constraints.

  abstract = {Background: This paper describes the development of a theory-informed and evidence-informed, contextspecific diffusion plan for the Mayday Safety Procedure (MSP) among community rugby coaches in regional New South Wales, Australia. Methods: Step 5 of Intervention Mapping was used to plan strategies to enhance MSP adoption and implementation. Results: Coaches were identified as the primary MSP adopters and implementers within a system including administrators, players and referees. A local advisory group was established to ensure context relevance. Performance objectives (eg, attend MSP training for coaches) and determinants of adoption and implementation behaviour (eg, knowledge, beliefs, skills and environment) were identified, informed by Social Cognitive Theory. Adoption and implementation matrices were developed and change-objectives for coaches were identified (eg, skills to deliver MSP training to players). Finally, intervention methods and specific strategies (eg, coach education, social marketing and policy and by-law development) were identified based on advisory group member experience, evidence of effective coach safety behaviour-change interventions and Diffusion of Innovations theory. Conclusions: This is the first published example of a systematic approach to plan injury prevention programme diffusion in community sports. The key strengths of this approach were an effective researcher-practitioner partnership; actively engaging local sports administrators; targeting specific behaviour determinants, informed by theory and evidence; and taking context-related practical strengths and constraints into consideration. The major challenges were the time involved in using a systematic diffusion planning approach for the first time; and finding a planning language that was acceptable and meaningful to researchers and practitioners.},

  title = {Knowledge and management of sports concussions among coaches and certified athletic trainers in Alabama},
  abstract = {Objectives: To identify modifiable barriers in resources, knowledge, and management that may improve the care of young athletes with concussions in the state of Alabama. Methods: An electronic survey was distributed to 2668 middle and high school coaches of contact sports in Alabama, and a paper survey was completed by 79 certified athletic trainers (ATCs) in 2010. Questions focused on their resource availability, knowledge of concussions based on the 2008 Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 3rd International Conference on Concussion in Sport (commonly known as the Zurich consensus statement), and management of concussions. Results: A total of 402 (16% response rate) coaches and 55 ATCs (70% response rate) responded to the survey. This study highlights that ATC coverage often is limited to the high school level, football, and competitions. Both coaches and ATCs primarily use physicians to make return-to-play decisions, although coaches (43.7%) usually refer to primary care physicians, whereas ATCs (43.6%) refer to orthopedic or sports medicine physicians. The study also revealed that coaches and ATCs desire education and could expand concussion awareness by providing education to parents and athletes. No overall difference was seen in the knowledge and management of concussions between coaches and ATCs; however, ATCs were more likely to identify symptoms that are positive for concussions (P = 0.04). Both groups had difficulty recognizing subtle symptoms such as trouble sleeping, personality changes, and dizziness; they also were unaware that strenuous mental activities could delay concussion recovery, although ATCs scored significantly better than coaches (P < 0.001). Neither coaches nor ATCs consistently use standardized measures such as the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool 2 (7.5% vs 56.4%) or neuropsychological testing (5.3% vs 14.5%). Conclusions: This study describes coaches' and ATCs' varying knowledge and management techniques and highlights areas in which targeted interventions and outreach could be useful. These areas include increased ATC availability, coach/ATC concussion education, improved parent/athlete education, increased "return to think" awareness, and more consistent use of Sports Concussion Assessment Tool 2.

  abstract = {Objective: Guided by self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1987), this study tested a trans-contextual model linking perceptions of the social environment created by the youth sport coach to levels of autonomous and controlled motivation, and objectively measured daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary time (ST) in young football players. Design: The study employed a cross-sectional design, assessing physical activity using accelerometers. Method: 105 male youth sport footballers (M age = 12.79 Â± 1.85 years) wore a GT3X accelerometer for 7 days. Measures of height and weight were recorded. Participants completed a multi-section questionnaire assessing perceptions of autonomy support and controlling coaching behaviours, and motivation toward their participation in sport and physically active games. Results: Path analysis supported a model in which players' perceptions of coach-provided autonomy support positively predicted autonomous motivation for sport engagement. In turn, autonomous motivation was positively associated with MVPA, and negatively related to ST (min/day). Controlling coach behaviours were positively linked to controlled motivation. However, controlled motivation for sport and physically active games was unrelated to daily MVPA and ST. Perceptions of coach-provided autonomy support had a significant positive indirect effect on daily MVPA, and a significant negative indirect effect on daily ST. Conclusions: Results suggest that autonomy supportive coach behaviours are related to daily physical activity patterns in young male footballers. Theory-based interventions that aim to encourage autonomy supportive coaching, and subsequently foster autonomous reasons for sport engagement, may enhance the potential of youth sport for increasing daily MVPA and reducing ST among children and adolescents active in this setting.

The horrific nature of the crimes shocked the community, but the unanswered questions surrounding the involvement of Penn State's most prominent administrators in a cover-up have implications for the pervasiveness of institutional violence within higher education.

Aim To evaluate team and player compliance with an NMT programme in adolescent female football and to study the association between compliance and acute knee injury rates. Methods Prospective cohort study based on a cluster randomised controlled trial on players aged 12-17 years with 184 intervention teams (2471 players) and 157 control teams (2085 players). Exposure and acute time loss knee injuries were recorded. Team and player compliance was recorded by the coaches on a player attendance form. The intervention group was divided into tertiles of compliance. Injury rates were compared by calculating rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs using exact Poisson tests with the low-compliance tertile as reference. Seasonal compliance trends were analysed using linear regression. Results Players in the high-compliance tertile had an 88% reduction in the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury rate (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.85), whereas the rate in the control group players was not significantly different from those in the low-compliance tertile (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.21). A significant deterioration occurred in team (b=-3.0% per month, 95% CI -5.2 to -0.8) and player (b=-5.0% per month, 95% CI -7.1 to -2.9) compliance over the season. Conclusions Players with high compliance with the NMT programme had significantly reduced ACL injury rate compared with players with low compliance.

  abstract = {Research arising from self-determination theory (SDT; Deci, E. L., & Ryan, R. M. (2000). The "what" and "why" of goal pursuits: Human needs and the self-determination of behavior. Psychological Inquiry, 11(4), 227-268) indicates that the quality of the social interactions between athletes and coaches, and athletes' ensuing psychological responses, are critical determinants of intentions to drop out of youth sport. Little is known regarding whether these processes hold across countries. Grounded in SDT, this study tested the invariance of a model predicting youth sport dropout across five European countries. Seven thousand seven hundred and sixty-nine grassroots players (6641 males, 1020 females (M age = 11.56, SD = 1.40) from youth soccer teams in five countries (England, France, Greece, Norway, and Spain) completed a questionnaire tapping perceptions of coach-provided autonomy support, basic psychological need satisfaction (i.e. autonomy, competence and relatedness), soccer enjoyment, and intentions to drop out of soccer in the next season. Data were analysed using structural equation modelling. The hypothesised model (autonomy support â†’ basic needs â†’ enjoyment â†’ intentions to drop out of soccer) showed an acceptable fit to the data and provided evidence of configural factor loading and structural path invariance across the five countries. This study supports the applicability of the basic needs theory model as a framework to understand the determinants of drop out intentions in sport among European youth across national boundaries. Findings highlight a potential avenue for intervention that could impact children's enjoyment of, and intentions to continue, playing soccer; namely, interventions that specifically target autonomy supportive coaching.

  title = {Neuromuscular Training to prevent knee injuries in adolescent female soccer players},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVE:: To evaluate the effectiveness of a neuromuscular warm-up program in preventing acute knee injury in adolescent female football (soccer) players. DESIGN:: Cluster randomized (by team) controlled trial, stratified by geographical district. Sample size was calculated (n = 8118) with 80% power to show a reduction of 50% in an estimated 1.15% annual incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury at P â‰¤0.05. SETTING:: Clubs in 8 regional districts of the Swedish Football Association, during the 2009 season (April through October). PARTICIPANTS:: Female under-14 to under-18 football clubs (ages 12-17 years) were recruited. Reasons for the exclusion of clubs were lack of response, <2 training sessions per week, and the current use of an injury prevention program. INTERVENTION:: The clubs were randomized to a neuromuscular warm-up intervention (KnÃ¤kontroll, SISU IdrottsbÃ¶cker, Sweden, 2005) or to a control group, who were instructed to continue with their usual training and playing practices. The neuromuscular training program included 6 exercises that focused on knee control and core stability (1-and 2-legged knee squats, a pelvic lift, the bench, the lunge, and jump/landing). The exercises were to be done twice per week and were to take about 15 minutes, after a brief running warm-up. They progressed through 4 levels of difficulty. The team coaches supervised the program after instruction from study therapists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:: The primary outcome was the rate of ACL injuries. Diagnosis was confirmed, as appropriate, by a physician and by magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary outcomes were the rates of serious knee injury and any acute knee injury, defined as those with sudden onset during play that led to a player being unable to participate in training or competition. Severe injuries were those that caused absences of >4 weeks. Two study therapists evaluated the injuries. The coaches recorded data, including when the intervention was performed, any injuries, individual playing times, and periods of absence. Assessment of the primary outcome was done by physicians blinded to group assignment. MAIN RESULTS:: During 278 298 hours of play, 96 knee injuries occurred in 92 players (intervention group 48, control group 44). The rate did not differ between groups. Of the 21 ACL injuries, 7 occurred in the intervention group and 14 in the control group, giving a rate ratio (RR) of 0.36 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15-0.85; P = 0.02). Severe injuries (intervention group 26, control group 31) did not differ between groups. They included 22 collateral or capsular sprains, 21 ACL injuries, 7 patella dislocations or subluxations, 6 meniscal or chondral lesions, and 1 tibial plateau fracture. Compliant players (those who performed â‰¥1 exercise session per week; 1303 players) had a lower rate of ACL injury (RR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.05-0.57), of severe knee injury (RR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.07-0.45), and of any acute knee injury (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.30-0.94) than the control group. CONCLUSIONS:: A short weekly neuromuscular exercise program reduced the rate of ACL injuries among adolescent female football (soccer) players. Those who were compliant with the intervention had fewer severe knee injuries and fewer injuries overall. 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

  abstract = {Background Injury prevention programme delivery on adherence and injury risk, specifically involving regular supervisions with coaches and players on programme execution on field, has not been examined. Aim The objective of this cluster-randomised study was to evaluate different delivery methods of an effective injury prevention programme (FIFA 11+) on adherence and injury risk among female youth football teams. Method During the 4-month 2011 football season, coaches and 13-year-old to 18-year-old players from 31 tier 1-3 level teams were introduced to the 11+ through either an unsupervised website ('control') or a coachfocused workshop with ('comprehensive') and without ('regular') additional supervisions by a physiotherapist. Team and player adherence to the 11+, playing exposure, history and injuries were recorded. Results Teams in the comprehensive and regular intervention groups demonstrated adherence to the 11+ programme of 85.6% and 81.3% completion of total possible sessions, compared to 73.5% for teams in the control group. These differences were not statistically significant, after adjustment for cluster by team, age, level and injury history. Compared to players with low adherence, players with high adherence to the 11+ had a 57% lower injury risk (IRR 0.43, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.00). However, adjusting for covariates, this betweengroup difference was not statistically significant (IRR=0.44, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.06). Conclusion Following a coach workshop, coach-led delivery of the FIFA 11+ was equally successful with or without the additional field involvement of a physiotherapist. Proper education of coaches during an extensive preseason workshop was more effective in terms of team adherence than an unsupervised delivery of the 11+ programme to the team.},

  title = {Injury incidence, risk factors and prevention in australian rules football},
  abstract = {Along with the enjoyment and the other positive benefits of sport participation, there is also the risk of injury that is elevated in contact sport. This review provides a summary of injury incidence in Australian Rules Football (ARF), identifies injury risk factors, assesses the efficacy of interventions to reduce injury risk and makes recommendations for future research. The most common injuries were found to be muscle strains, particularly hamstrings; joint ligament sprains, especially ankle; haematomas and concussion. The most severe joint injury was anterior cruciate ligament rupture. Mouthguards are commonly worn and have been shown to reduce orofacial injury. There is evidence that thigh pads can reduce the incidence of thigh haematomas. There is a reluctance to wear padded headgear and an attempt to assess its effectiveness was unsuccessful due to low compliance. The most readily identified risk factor was a history of that injury. There were conflicting findings as to the influence strength imbalances or deficit has on hamstring injury risk in ARF. Static hamstring flexibility was not related to risk but low hip flexor/quadriceps flexibility increased hamstring injury risk. High lower-limb and high hamstring stiffness were associated with an elevated risk of hamstring injury. Since stiffness can be modulated through strength or flexibility training, this provides an area for future intervention studies. Low postural balance ability was related to a greater risk of ankle injury in ARF, players with poor balance should be targeted for balance training. There are preliminary data signifying a link between deficiencies in hip range of motion and hip adductor strength with groin pain or injury. This provides support for future investigation into the effectiveness of an intervention for high-risk players on groin injury rate. Low cross-sectional area of core-region muscle has been associated with more severe injuries and a motor control exercise intervention that increased core muscle size and function resulted in fewer games missed due to injury. A randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of eccentric hamstring exercise in decreasing hamstring injury rate in ARF players was unsuccessful due to poor compliance from muscle soreness; a progressive eccentric training intervention for ARF should be given future consideration. Jump and landing training reduced injury risk in junior ARF players and it would be advisable to include this component as part of a neuromuscular training intervention. A multifaceted programme of sport-specific drills for hamstring flexibility while fatigued, sport skills that load the hamstrings and high-intensity interval training to mimic match playing conditions showed some success in reducing the incidence of hamstring injuries in ARF. A countermeasure designed to reduce injury risk is more likely to be adopted by coaches and players if it also has the scope to enhance performance.

  title = {An individualized longitudinal approach to monitoring the dynamics of growth and fitness development in adolescent athletes},
  abstract = {This study evaluated the development of anthropometric and fitness characteristics of 3 individual adolescent junior rugby league players and compared their characteristics with a cross-sectional population matched by age and skill level. Cross-sectional anthropometric and fitness assessments were conducted on 1,172 players selected to the Rugby Football League's talent development program (i.e., the Player Performance Pathway) between 2005 and 2008. Three players of differing relative age, maturational status, and playing position were measured and tracked once per year on 3 occasions (Under 13s, 14s, 15s age categories) and compared against the cross-sectional population. Results demonstrated that the later maturing players increased height (player 1 = 9.2%; player 2 = 7.8%) and a number of fitness characteristics (e.g., 60-m speed-player 1 = -14.9%; player 2 = -9.9%) more than the earlier maturing player (player 3-Height = 2.0%, 60-m sprint = -0.7%) over the 2-year period. The variation in the development of anthropometric and fitness characteristics between the 3 players highlights the importance of longitudinally monitoring individual characteristics during adolescence to assess the dynamic changes in growth, maturation, and fitness. Findings showcase the limitations of short-term performance assessments at one-off time points within annual-age categories, instead of advocating individual development and progression tracking without deselection. Coaches should consider using an individual approach, comparing data with population averages, to assist in the prescription of appropriate training and lifestyle interventions to aid the development of junior athletes.

  title = {Football Fans in Training: The development and optimization of an intervention delivered through professional sports clubs to help men lose weight, become more active and adopt healthier eating habits},
  abstract = {Background: The prevalence of obesity in men is rising, but they are less likely than women to engage in existing weight management programmes. The potential of professional sports club settings to engage men in health promotion activities is being increasingly recognised. This paper describes the development and optimization of the Football Fans in Training (FFIT) programme, which aims to help overweight men (many of them football supporters) lose weight through becoming more active and adopting healthier eating habits. Methods. The MRC Framework for the design and evaluation of complex interventions was used to guide programme development in two phases. In Phase 1, a multidisciplinary working group developed the pilot programme (p-FFIT) and used a scoping review to summarize previous research and identify the target population. Phase 2 involved a process evaluation of p-FFIT in 11 Scottish Premier League (SPL) clubs. Participant and coach feedback, focus group discussions and interviews explored the utility/acceptability of programme components and suggestions for changes. Programme session observations identified examples of good practice and problems/issues with delivery. Together, these findings informed redevelopment of the optimized programme (FFIT), whose components were mapped onto specific behaviour change techniques using an evidence-based taxonomy. Results: p-FFIT comprised 12, weekly, gender-sensitised, group-based weight management classroom and 'pitch-side' physical activity sessions. These in-stadia sessions were complemented by an incremental, pedometer-based walking programme. p-FFIT was targeted at men aged 35-65 years with body mass index â‰¥ 27 kg/mÂ§ssupÂ§2Â§esupÂ§. Phase 2 demonstrated that participants in p-FFIT were enthusiastic about both the classroom and physical activity components, and valued the camaraderie and peer-support offered by the programme. Coaches appreciated the simplicity of the key healthy eating and physical activity messages. Suggestions for improvements that were incorporated into the optimized FFIT programme included: more varied in-stadia physical activity with football-related components; post-programme weight management support (emails and a reunion session); and additional training for coaches in SMART goal setting and the pedometer-based walking programme. Conclusions: The Football Fans in Training programme is highly acceptable to participants and SPL coaches, and is appropriate for evaluation in a randomised controlled trial.

Specifically, exploring the effectiveness of this intervention from the perspectives of the participants involved (i.e. the researcher, teachers, children and coaches). A range of data collection techniques were utilized including the principles of ethnography (i.e. immersion, engagement and observations), alongside conducting focus groups with the children. The results allude to the intervention merely 'keeping active children active' via (mostly) fun, football sessions. Results highlight the important contribution the 'coach' plays in the effectiveness of the intervention. Results relating to working practice (i.e. coaching practice and coach recruitment) are discussed and highlighted as areas to be addressed. FitC schemes appear to require a process of positive organizational change to increase their effectiveness in strategically attending to the health agenda.

The aim of this study was to design and test a reliable method of analysing decision-making performance and to use it to evaluate decision making and transfer of training into competition matches. Thirteen elite Australian football (AF) players were analysed over four matches (early season and late season), using a custom-designed decision-making notational analysis system. The performance indicator, decision accuracy, was based on a three-point scale allocated by three elite AF coaches. Other factors measured included number of options available, level of defensive pressure, match context and execution elements. Inter-rater reliability of the notational analysis system was high for all performance indicators (kappa range = .79 - .98). Decision accuracy increased from early to late season while defensive pressure and number of options available for each decision did not differ between games. This research creates an reliable new platform for future research to build upon in order to further develop our ability to measure cognitive skills such as decision making in live match situations, and to also effectively measure transfer of performance gains through off field training interventions.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To identify barriers to concussive symptom reporting in high school athletics. Methods: We conducted a qualitative focus group study with varsity high school athletes from three football, two boys' soccer, and four girls' soccer teams in the Seattle, WA, area (50 participants). Professional moderators led the groups with a standardized script that discussed concussion knowledge as well as hypothetical concussion scenarios. Focus groups were recorded and transcribed, and transcripts were analyzed by two investigators using thematic analysis with Atlas.ti. Results: Athletes could describe multiple signs and symptoms of concussion. Athletes also understood the dangers of concussions, and all groups mentioned the possibility of death or long-term disability. However, when confronted with scenarios involving concussive symptoms, athletes reported they would not stop playing. They would either continue to play (6/9 groups) or would take a brief break and then return to play (3/9 groups). Several barriers seemed to explain athletes' responses. Athletes wanted to keep playing and knew that reporting symptoms might result in being removed from the game. In addition, concussive symptoms were nonspecific, and thus could be mistaken for another etiology. Finally, athletes were hesitant to report symptoms to coaches if they did not result in significant pain or disability. Conclusions: There are several barriers to concussive symptom reporting in high school athletics. Athlete concussion knowledge does not seem to be a barrier, but coach approachability may be an issue. Interventions that seek to improve coach communication with athletes regarding concussion management might increase symptom reporting. Â© 2013 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

Twelve English youth professional coaches were observed over a five-month period using the Coach Analysis and Intervention System (CAIS). Two sets of interpretive interviews were subsequently utilized to identify the underlying processes and motivations for their behaviour. Using the work of Goffman as a lens to probe the data, it is suggested that coaching behaviour during games was largely performative, with the coaches' behaviours dependent on social pressures and constraints. It is thus contended that the outcome was a form of â€˜traditional coachingâ€™ employed as impression management, as opposed to behaviours linked to pedagogical principles or the needs of athletes.

J Strength Cond Res 26(10): 2748-2754, 2012-The present study examined the effects of periodized small-sided game (SSG) training intervention during a 4-week in-season break on the physical performance changes (i.e., speed, aerobic performance, and repeated sprint ability) within elite European soccer players. Fifteen, elite, male, professional players (age: 24.5 6 3.45 years; height: 181.1 Â± 5.78 cm; body mass: 78.7 6 7.67 kg; VO2max: 54.88 Â± 5.25 ml.kg21.min-1) from a Scottish Premier League team participated in 7 separate SSG sessions (3 vs. 3 plus goalkeepers) of which games lasted for a 3-minute duration for the selected number of games (ranged from 5 to 11) increasing over the intervention period. To examine the effects of the SSG intervention on physical performance changes, pre- and posttesting sessions took place over a 2-day period (day 1: anthropometry and repeated sprint ability [RSA] assessments; day 2: running economy [RE] and blood lactate assessments). Results show that the 4-week SSG training intervention induced significant improvement in RSA as indicated by faster 10-m sprint time (p &lt; 0.05, small effect), total sprint time (p &lt; 0.05, medium effect), and smaller percentage decrement score (p &lt; 0.05, medium effect). Furthermore, the SSGs also led to an improvement in RE as indicated through significantly reduced VO2 and heart rate at running speed 9, 11, and 14 km.h-1 (all p's &lt; 0.05, large effects). In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that implementing a periodized SSG training intervention during the 4-week in-season break is capable of improving elite-level soccer players' physical fitness characteristics. Being able to develop physical characteristics in conjunction to technical and tactical elements of the game, within a relatively short period, makes SSGs an appealing proposition for fitness coaches, players, and technical coaches alike.

J Strength Cond Res 26(10): 2712-2720, 2012-The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of small-sided games (SSGs) in soccer versus high-intensity intermittent training (HIT) on a continuous aerobic test (Vameval) and the performance in an intermittent test with changes of direction (CODs; 30-15 intermittent fitness test [30-15 IFT]). Twenty-two amateur soccer players (mean age Â± SD: 26.3 6 4.7 years) were assigned to 3 different groups for 6 weeks: SSG group (n = 8), HIT group (n = 8), and control group (CG; n = 6). In addition to the usual technical and tactical sessions and competitive games, the SSG group performed 9 sessions of 2 versus 2 and 1 versus 1 SSGs, whereas the HIT group performed 9 sessions of intermittent runs in the form of 30 seconds of effort interspersed with 30 seconds of passive recovery (30s-30s), 15s-15s, and 10s-10s. The HIT and SSG groups showed performance improvements in the Vameval test (5.1 and 6.6%, respectively) and the 30-15IFT intermittent test with CODs (5.1 and 5.8%, respectively), whereas there was no change in the performance of the CG. Players from HIT and SSG groups showed similar increase in their performance in the 30-15IFT and the Vameval tests during the 6-week training period, especially with an increase significantly different to that in a traditional training as in the CG (p &lt; 0.05). This investigation demonstrates that both SSG and HIT interventions are equally effective in developing the aerobic capacity and the ability to perform intermittent exercises with CODs in male amateur soccer players. Furthermore, these 2 methods of training applied during the 6 weeks induce similar effect on the recovery capacity and on the ability to repeat directional changes of 180Â°. Coaches will now be able to choose between these two methods according to the objective of the training and to optimize the training. Â© 2012 National Strength and Conditioning Association.},

  abstract = {We examined the effect of different pre-match motivational interventions on athlete free testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) concentrations and subsequent match performance in professional rugby union. Male participants (n = 12) playing at a senior or academy level in rugby union were recruited and each completed three interventions (15. min each) before a competitive game; 1) watching a video clip of successful skill execution by the player with positive coach feedback [VPCF1]; 2) watching a video clip of successful skill execution by an opposing player with cautionary coach feedback [VCCF], 3) the player left alone to self-motivate [SM1]. The first and last interventions were retested [VPCF2 and SM2]. Salivary free T and C measures were taken pre-intervention and pre-game. Within each game, players were rated by coaching staff on a key performance indicator (KPI) from identified skills and an overall performance indicator (OPI), where 1 = best performance to 5 = worst performance. The VPCF1 and VPCF2 interventions both promoted significant T responses (11.8% to 12.5%) before each game and more so than SM1, SM2 and VCCF. The VCCF approach produced the largest C response (17.6%) and this differed from all other treatments. The VPCF interventions were also associated with better game KPI (1.5 to 1.8) and OPI ratings (1.7 to 1.8) than SM1, SM2 and/or VCCF. Across all treatments, greater individual T responses and lower C responses were associated with better KPI and OPI outcomes. In conclusion, the pre-game presentation of motivational strategies to athletes involving specific video footage and coach feedback produced different outcomes on two indicators of match performance, which were also associated with changes in free hormonal state.

  abstract = {Muslim athletes should fast from sunrise to sunset each day throughout the 30 days of Ramadan. Most athletes will continue to train throughout Ramadan, and they may also be required to compete at this time, but they will also engage in the religious, cultural, and social activities that Ramadan represents. The available evidence indicates that high-level athletes can maintain performance during Ramadan if physical training, food and fluid intake, and sleep are appropriate and well controlled. Individualized monitoring of athletes may help to prevent fatigue and overtraining and to reduce the risk of consequent illness and injury. The timing and intensity of training may require adjustment to optimize the training response, and training close to or after sunset may have advantages, but this will vary between individual and team sports and between environments that are predominantly Muslim and those that are predominantly non-Muslim. Training late in the day allows nutrition interventions after training to promote adaptations to the training stimulus, to promote recovery, and might help to reduce muscle damage. Sleep deficits have a number of adverse effects on well-being and performance, and athletes should ensure adequate sleep throughout Ramadan. In non-Muslim majority environments, especially in team sports, coaches and athletes should be sensitive to the needs of their team-mates who may be fasting. Event organizers should take account of the needs of Muslim athletes when scheduling the dates and timings of sports competitions. Â© 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

On four occasions, participants (n = 12) completed a video session (1. h each) with accompanying coach feedback the day after a rugby union match. The interventions showed either video footage of player mistakes with negative coach feedback (NCF1) or player successes with positive feedback (PCF1). Both approaches were repeated (NCF2 and PCF2). In the following week, participants were assessed for their free testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) responses to a physical stress-test, pre-game T and game-ranked performance. The PFC1 and PCF2 approaches were both associated with significantly (p< 0.01) greater free T (36% to 42%) responses to the stress-test when compared to NCF1 and NCF2 (16% to - 3%), respectively. The PCF interventions were also associated with higher (28% to 51%) pre-game T concentrations and superior game-ranked performances than the NCF approaches (p< 0.01). In conclusion, the post-game presentation of specific video footage combined with different coach feedbacks appeared to influence the free hormonal state of rugby players and game performance several days later. Therefore, within the sporting context, future behaviour and performance might be modified through the use of simple psychological strategies. These data are applicable to generalised human stress responses and their modifiability by prior exposure to a stressor. Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {This study examined on-field antisocial sports behaviors among 274 American football players in the United States. Results indicated that moral atmosphere (i.e., teammate, coach influence) and conformity to masculine norms were significantly related to participants' moral behavior on the field (i.e., intimidate, risk injury, cheat, intentionally injure opponents). In other words, the perception that coaches and teammates condone on-field antisocial behaviors-in addition to conforming to societal expectations of traditional masculinity-is related to higher levels of antisocial behaviors on the football field. In addition, conformity to traditional masculine norms mediated the relationship between moral atmosphere and on-field aggressive sports behaviors, suggesting a relationship between social norms and moral atmosphere. Results of this interdisciplinary endeavor are interpreted and situated within the extant literature of both the fields of sport psychology and the psychological study of men and masculinity. Sport psychologists can use results to design interventions that incorporate moral atmosphere and conformity to masculine norms in an effort to decrease aggressive sports behaviors in the violent sport of football.

The scheme, run in association with a professional football club, provided informal, personalised mentoring and a range of sports-based activities (primarily football) to young people in schools and housing estates in areas suffering from high levels of deprivation in the South of England. The interventions were intended to raise the aspirations of the young people and divert them away from crime and antisocial behaviour. While being mindful of the limitations of mentoring, this paper discusses the value of the positive male role models provided by the informal relationships between the young people and the football coaches and their role in enhancing the self-esteem and self-efficacy of the young people involved.

  abstract = {Agility is an open motor skill; requiring change of direction speed (CODS) and perceptual and decision-making ability. The aim of this study was to determine whether the perceptual and decision-making component of agility can be trained. Fifteen rugby league players were tested on a sportspecific reactive agility test (RAT) and a CODS test. Players were then allocated to a training group (n = 8) or a nontraining group (n = 7). The training group underwent 3 weeks of reactive agility training that was designed to enhance perceptual and decision-making ability. After 3 weeks, all players were tested again. The training group's mean reactive agility time was 1.92 Â± 0.17 seconds preintervention and 1.66 Â± 0.14 seconds postintervention. The nontraining group's mean reactive agility time was 1.89 Â± 0.16 and 1.87 Â± 0.15 seconds, respectively. Mean CODS time for the training group was 1.64 Â± 0.15 seconds preintervention and 1.66 Â± 0.14 seconds postintervention. The nontraining group's mean CODS time was 1.61 Â± 0.12 and 1.62 Â± 0.12 seconds. Mean perception and response time for the training group, measured on the RAT, was 0.33 Â± 0.33 seconds preintervention and 0.04 Â± 0.22 seconds postintervention. The nontraining group's values were 0.34 Â± 0.20 and 0.27 Â± 0.28 seconds, respectively (results are Â±Ïƒ). Differences in mean reactive agility time and perception and response time from pre to postintervention for the training group were statistically significant, as were differences in those values between the training and nontraining group post intervention. All other comparisons were not. Results from this study suggest that the perceptual and decision-making components of agility are trainable. Coaches should incorporate some open motor skills training in their programs when training agility. Â© 2011 National Strength and Conditioning Association.},

In designing the evaluation for the Respect pilot the researchers attempted to adhere to best practice in programme evaluation by addressing both the process and outcomes of the intended change programme (Coalter, 2007; Pawson, 2006; Weiss, 1998) and by working with a logic model that could be adapted over time (Aspen Institute, 2003; Schmitz and Parsons, 2007). The four main stakeholder groups identified to take part in the pilot were players, coaches, referees and spectators/parents, for three age groups - Under 10, Under 16 and Open Age. Three different interventions were tested at the matches: designated spectator areas, codes of conduct with sanctions and only the captain being allowed to talk to the referee. Interviews were conducted with the four stakeholder groups at three games in each age group. In addition, week-by-week behaviour assessments from 583 trial games were entered on-line by over 1,000 people. Overall, both enjoyment and behaviour scores among the Active (experimental) teams were perceived to be significantly better than those among the matched Control teams (with no interventions). The experimental teams also ranked all three interventions highly over the ten weeks, with the designated spectator areas rated best, followed by the signing of codes of practice second and only captains talking to referees third. The results are discussed in relation to the future plans for the Respect programme and the efficacy of the original logic model. Â© 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

  title = {Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an injury prevention programme for adult male amateur soccer players: Design of a cluster-randomised controlled trial},
  abstract = {Background and aims Approximately 16% of all sports injuries in the Netherlands are caused by outdoor soccer. A cluster-randomised controlled trial has been designed to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an injury prevention programme ('The11') for male amateur soccer players. The injury prevention programme The11, developed with the support of the World Football Association FIFA, aims to reduce the impact of intrinsic injury risk factors in soccer. Methods Teams playing at first-class amateur level in two districts in the Netherlands are participating in the study. Teams in the intervention group were instructed to apply The11 during each practice session throughout the 2009e10 season. All participants of the control group continued their practice sessions as usual. All soccer-related injuries and related costs for each team were systematically reported online by a member of the medical staff. Player exposure to practice sessions and matches was reported weekly by the coaches. Also the use of The11 during the season after the intervention season will be monitored. Discussion Our hypothesis is that integrating the The11 exercises in the warm-up for each practice session is effective in terms of injury incidence, injury severity, healthcare use, and its associated costs and/or absenteeism. Prevention of soccer injuries is expected to be beneficial to adult soccer players, soccer clubs, the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB), health insurance companies and society.},

  title = {Compliance with a comprehensive warm-up programme to prevent injuries in youth football},
  abstract = {Background Participants' compliance, attitudes and beliefs have the potential to infl uence the effi cacy of an intervention greatly. Objective To characterise team and player compliance with a comprehensive injury prevention warm-up programme for football (The 11+), and to assess attitudes towards injury prevention among coaches and their association with compliance and injury risk. Study Design A prospective cohort study and retrospective survey based on a cluster-randomised controlled trial with teams as the unit of randomisation. Methods Compliance, exposure and injuries were registered prospectively in 65 of 125 football teams (1055 of 1892 female Norwegian players aged 13-17 years and 65 of 125 coaches) throughout one football season (March-October 2007). Standardised telephone interviews were conducted to assess coaches' attitudes towards injury prevention. Results Teams completed the injury prevention programme in 77% (mean 1.3 sessions per week) of all training and match sessions, and players in 79% (mean 0.8 sessions per week) of the sessions they attended. Compared with players with intermediate compliance, players with high compliance with the programme had a 35% lower risk of all injuries (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.91, p=0.011). Coaches who had previously utilised injury prevention training coached teams with a 46% lower risk of injury (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.87, p=0.011). Conclusions Compliance with the injury prevention programme was high, and players with high compliance had signifi cantly lower injury risk than players with intermediate compliance. Positive attitudes towards injury prevention correlated with high compliance and lower injury risk.},

  title = {Policy, sport and integration: The case of talented ethnic minority players in danish football clubs},
  abstract = {Increased public funding, more governmental involvement and an emphasis on the instrumental values of physical activities have in general become characteristic of Western nations' policies towards sport. Denmark is, however, a little different in that there is still little political intervention in sport, although sports clubs do get economic support and are seen as having the potential to solve crucial social issues. The purpose of this article is to analyse and discuss the ways in which the political assumption that sport can enhance social integration is reflected in the practical governance of integration issues in particular in sports clubs. The article is based on a local field study in which we interviewed 10 talented football players with ethnic minority backgrounds and eight coaches and club leaders from six different football clubs. Distinguishing between integration and assimilation, the analysis shows that coaches (and the Danish football governing bodies) employ a strategy of integration towards ethnic minority players' different preferences for food and clothing. However, in the daily practice of football the clubs have an implicit strategy of assimilation. The coaches attempt to treat everyone the same (no matter the ethnicity and background of the players). Inspired by anthropological studies this is analysed as a common way to downplay differences between the members of a society (or in this case a football team and club) and to enhance instead an 'imagined sameness' that is central to the national self-understanding in Nordic countries. This leads us to discuss a possible change of strategy for elite sports clubs to develop explicit policies for their work with ethnic minorities. Â© 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

  abstract = {Functional analysis (FA) is an experimental methodology for identifying the behavior-reinforcing effects of social and non-social consequences. The data produced from a FA are used to select intervention procedures. In this case study, we conducted a FA with a male high school football athlete by manipulating social contingencies within practice tackling drills. The FA suggested that the highest percentage of correct tackling occurred when the participant was able to â€œescapeâ€  interaction with the coach following drills. After demonstrating that the participant had a low percentage of correct tackling during a baseline (preintervention) phase, the coach provided him delayed written performance feedback after practice. This intervention was associated with a higher percentage of correct tackling. The participant also tackled proficiently during a postintervention in-game assessment. The advantages of conducting a FA when intervening with athletes are discussed. Â© 2010 Human Kinetics, Inc.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To develop, implement and assess an interactive, football-based health education programme for children in South Africa. Design: Prospective cohort study with control group. Setting: Two schools in Khayelitsha township, South Africa. Participants: 370 children making up two intervention groups (Grade 6:125; Grade 7:131) and one control group (Grade 7:114). Intervention: Eleven 90 min sessions, each divided into two 45 min halves of Play Football (football skills) and Play Fair (health issues), each session focused on one specific health risk factor. Main outcome measures: Health knowledge using a 20-item questionnaire; coaches' attitudes towards their training programme using a 10-item questionnaire and children's attitudes towards the health education programme using a six-item questionnaire. Results: Children in the Grade 7 intervention group showed significant (p<0.05) increases in the proportion of correct responses for nine of the 20 health knowledge questions postintervention, and these increases were maintained at 3 months postintervention. The Grade 6 intervention group showed signifi-cant increases in the proportion of correct responses for 15 of the 20 health knowledge questions postintervention. The Grade 7 control group showed a signifi-cant increase in the proportion of correct responses to one of the 20 health knowledge questions post-Play Football sessions and nine of 20 questions post-Play Fair sessions. Over 90% of the children provided positive attitude responses to the health-education programme. Conclusions: The programme demonstrated that it was possible to implement a football-based healtheducation programme for children in Africa that achieved significant increases in health knowledge and that was also well received by participants.},

  abstract = {Heat injury is a potentially lethal condition that is considered to be completely preventable. Fatal heat injury is relatively rare (0.20 per 100 000 player-seasons in US high school football) and there are very limited data on non-fatal incidence. Expert recommendations for prevention include gradual acclimatisation of youth athletes to hot conditions, reductions in activity in hot and humid conditions, wearing light and light-coloured clothing, careful monitoring of athletes for signs of heat injury to facilitate immediate detection, having the resources to immediately and rapidly cool affected athletes, and education of athletes, care givers, and coaches about heat injury. Although a base of observational case data, physiological information, and expert opinion exists, the science surrounding this field is devoid of health communication and health behaviour research, and there is a pressing need for analytical studies to evaluate intervention programmes and/or identify new risk factors. There is also a need for ongoing data collection on heat injury incidence and on the knowledge, attitudes and behaviours towards heat injury among youth athletes, their care givers and their coaches.},

  title = {Using positive relationships to engage the disengaged: An educational psychologist-initiated project involving professional sports input to a pupil referral unit},
  abstract = {Increasingly large numbers of students who experience emotional, social and behavioural difficulties are subject to exclusion from mainstream schools and consequently receive their education in pupil referral units (PRUs). Common perceptions of PRUs are that they are places where high levels of conflict and relatively few constructive relationships occur. In the regular educational psychologist input to an inner city secondary PRU, ideas from a range of psychological models and theories including humanist psychology, personal construct psychology, solution-focused brief therapy and systemic theory were used to highlight some exceptions to these social difficulties. More constructive social interaction and reduced levels of conflict were observed when students engaged in sports activities together and, therefore, the professional coaching input of a local premiership football clubâ€™s (XFCâ€™s) â€˜Sport in the Communityâ€™ programme (SiC) was negotiated and an initial eight-week evaluation project constructed. This paper considers the importance of relationships within the rationale, planning, implementation and evaluation of the project which developed. One of the central aims of this project was to utilise and support the development of more positive relationships between the pupils, the PRU staff and the professional sports coaches in order to engage the pupils more constructively in their educational experience and to support their social and emotional development and their learning in general. The consistently positive feedback from the students, PRU staff and coaches, which emphasised the importance of the relational aspects of the project is considered in relation to further possible interventions and research undertaken by applied psychologists working in education.

  abstract = {Intake of dietary supplements is widespread among athletes in developed countries. This study evaluated the use of dietary supplements in athletes from a developing country. Dietary supplementation practices of 113 national-level athletes age 15-35 yr in Sri Lanka were assessed. All athletes from track-and-field, badminton, football, swimming, cycling, and karate squads who consented to participate in the study were administered an anonymous questionnaire by an interviewer. Information on number of supplements taken, frequency of use, nature of product, rationale, sources of advice, and reasons for taking supplements was obtained. Most athletes (94%) consumed dietary supplements. On average, 3.7 products/day were consumed. Footballers had significantly lower intake of supplements than other athletes (footballers 71%, others 98%; p < .05). They also consumed fewer products per day (footballers 0.7, others 3.5; p < .05). Popular supplements included multivitamins, vitamin E, calcium, energy foods and drinks, and creatine. Multiple supplement use was common, with 29% athletes taking 4 products/day. The athletes sought advice on supplement use from sports doctors (45%), team coaches (40%), or friends (15%). Most took supplements to improve performance (79%), and 19% claimed to take supplements to improve their overall health status. Dietary supplement use is widespread among national-level Sri Lankan athletes. The ad hoc use of supplements indicates that educational intervention in the sporting community is essential.
